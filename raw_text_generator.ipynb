inside not trying to brag about my skills at predicting im saying that what trump is was always obvious and anybody who voted for him should be understood as being profascist from the getgo nobody gets to say they did not knowtrumps comment that he was going to activate bill barr makes me wonder whether our attorney general when his staff goes home on friday just powers down at his desk for the weekendthis is sad and nobody is doing anything about this heres a list of companies supporting trumps reelection bang inn n out chick fil a taco bell mcdonalds wendys kfc pizza hut olive garden

did thank you president trump last night in minneapolis is this what voters want with sleepy joe all demsits my bad though the way america mishandled covid should have been enough to radicalize every single one of us but that was a relatively slow burn donald trump just declared war on us that will do it expeditiouslywords from our own president four months ago what an example trump is basically begging to be photoshopped after he stood outside this church with a bible send us yours and we will round up the funniest blame democrats for this shit going on in all the citiesbut i blame republicans as well being pussies not standing up to the democrats for being weak and letting democrats ruin our country yes i know blame both parties for this lawlessness trump bring out militaryso trump calls out the military to teargas peaceful protesters for a photo op in front of a church holding a bibleno political motivation was theredo we wake up to martial law tomorrowis this guy all good he always answers like hes scared to piss someone off like he does not wanna fuck his white sunday lines lolthread president trump says these protests are professionally organized and the result of domestic terrorists and anarchists based on my reporting on the ground today the vast majority of people gathering outside of the white house are everyday americans demanding changewhen people stand up for their rights and autocrats have no other option they always play the religion card holding the quran holding the bible will response to trump be tomorrowas bold and firm as it has been opposing the tories the corona virus pandemic catastrophe who can expect cuomo or de blasio to do anythingthey have important work to do like criticizing trumps tonesilly me i thought a line was crossed when rioters started looting and burning cities to the ground trump did not start this but hes going to end itin the uk the foreign secretary will not comment on trump in australia a news crew is attacked by the us police and the prime minister gets involved immediately spot the difference yethe did not give me an opportunity to even speak george floyds brother philonise floyd described how his conversation with donald trump wentit was hardhe just kept like pushing me off like i do not want to hear what youre talking about this is why there is a silent majority who hates these far left actual racists trump more years and you will never know that your coworker and people sitting next to you on a train or in a line at a store are voting for trumpi pray for a new day in our nation when we have eradicated these plagues that we face covid and racism chicagos mayor lori lightfoot calls out pres trump for inciting violence and trying to inflame racist urges for political gain find it rather preposterous that people who vehemently condemn general buharis government its decisions and mannerisms are vehemently supporting donald trump even as he appears to be reading from the playbook of nigerias leadership style the hypocrisy can make one purgedonald trumpthreatened war crimes on irandownplayed the pandemic while forcing all whitehouse staff to get tested dailydisrespected several fallen veteransthreatened to kill his own citizens utilizing their right to protesthas several rape accusations against him piers morgan he failed to protect america from covid now a cowardly president fuels the fires and fiddles in his bunker as america burns with rage at george floyds despicable murder by police shame on you mr trumpjust because kamala calls trump a dictator she is suddenly a hero when she exploited the systemic racism to jail hundreds of black and brown people liberals are just as much idiots as conservatives donald trump is going to be so pissed that our video will still have more views and we did not need tear gas to make it knows exactly what hes doing he knows that the worlds largest armed underground white supremacist movement will gladly work alongside the worlds largest military rd largest police force to kill incarcerate otherwise brutalize protestors this is horrifyingis not late jan feb when biden said it was racist for donald trump to shut down travel from the epicenter of the viral outbreak im fairly certain he was not advocating for locking down america while simultaneously not wanting to lock down travel from the origin of the virussecret revealed this is how trump was put to win in even the fbi agent knew itbut he will not manage to win again in mark this tweet were legions had peaceful protestors tear gassed so he could have a photo opthe lord tests the righteous but his soul hates the wicked and the one who loves violence psalm after i assume room temp and join jesus historians are gonna have a field day with i certainly hope that president trump is given the honor he deserves in defending america and the left is represented with a jaundiced eye and a sigh of disgust for their evil actionsdonald trump was denounced by the leadership of the church he used for a photoop after having innocent people tear gassed so he could walk across the street unencumbered by protests dictatorstyle responds to trumpthe us system of policing is broken and needs systemic reform to root out racism the president swore an oath to the nation to protect all of its people not just those he deems worthy the laws of your nation rich white son of an racist oligarch raping and stealing and invading other nations becomes presidentpoor black guy who allegedly paid with a fake dollar bill gets tortured and killed by police entirely peaceful protest was gathering outside the white house on monday night when it was broken up with a volley of tear gas and some of the most aggressive policing i have yet seen here writes in washington mariann budde the episcopal bishop of washington was seething mad when she spoke to the about teargassing peaceful protesters for a staged photo op in front of her church are signs overnight of military preparations possibly to back up president trumps threat to use regular military forces as opposed to national guard against those on the streets trump ordered an assault on protestors with rubber bullets and tear gas so he could stand in front of a church and hold up the bible clearly he has no sense of what is in the good bookthings like love peace and reconciliationtrump is a lesson to all tbr free worlds regardless of the laws or how strong institutions are one useless president can bring back the dark ages one useless president thats what they did trump shooting people in their homes and you bless them for what theyve done speak but do not shoutwalk in peace but do not vandalizeand remember the nightmare of covid is real so avoid crowding trump walking to st johns church right now is the most powerful thing ive seen a president do in my lifetimeamerica wont stand for anarchy and tyranny this violence and terrorism ends nowdefense officials tell cnn there was growing discomfort among some in the pentagon even before trump announced that he is ready to deploy the military to enforce order inside the united states gujarat event responsible for virus crisis in mumbai sanjay rautraut alleged that the event held in ahmedabad to welcome trump in feb was responsible for the spread of coronavirus in gujarat later in mumbai and delhi west point cadets who trump forced back to school so he could give a speech have now tested positive for the coronavirus my tweet made trump supporters feel marginalized stereotyped or prejudged thats how black people have felt for hundreds of yearsthey have to deal w unspeakable atrocities a rigged system holding them down remember that next time u bitch about tweets erdoan did in to be elected as president declared state of emergency staged a fake coup and called it later a gift from good detainedeliminated political opponents detained journalists maybe trump will do it like erdoan it funny how trump was calling mexicans rapists yet he turned out to be raping abusing little boys and girls this whole time sir was really projecting his own insecurities onto minorities i will never understand how so many hispanics support that piece of shit do betterresisters good morning these are stressing times for us i hope everyone is well try to have patience watch trumphe is destroying himself trump is digging his own hole it looks he will fall in pull the dirt in on himself lives matter free uyghur muslims in china free palestine israel does not exist fuck trump black lives matter free uyghur muslims in china free palestine israel does not exist fuck trump just reported that trump did this because he was upset about coverage of him being taken to a bunkerwanted people to see him walking out of the white house military you took an oath to support and defend the constitution and to protect the country from all enemies foreign and domestic trump ordered you to use military force to clear peaceful protesters from a park that was an illegal order what is your duty here hmmthe federal government launched tear gas at protestors who were peaceably assembled to petition the government for a redress of grievances there was no curfew in place these were not looters it would be difficult for trump to violate the constitution more directlythe proud boys is a terrorist organizationthe nra is a terrorist organizationthe gop is a terrorist organizationthe trump family is a terrorist organizationyou ca not tell me otherwisewhile we are distracted boris johnson is selling britain to trump nhs up for sale chlorinated chicken on its way making a deal with the president who is burning everything in his path farage demands meeting with eu to warn against brexit delay do you get the impression that nigel is feeling a bit of a spare part perhaps trump could find a use for him we certainly ca not in memory of my great aunts who were killed in the holocaust i denounce donald trump the racistinchief trump is no longer the the states are not unitedwhy is he fuelling the fire and not calling for calmhe is going to try to delay the electionas trump speaks in rose garden this is the scene north of white house split in half and continue to be pushed minutes from curfew is responding to the by urging all governors to call out the he threatened to send the us to states that did not comply these are the

cylinder hike on journalists near white house by federal police clearing the way for trump to get his photoop in front of a church holding a bible the cameraman and reporter from australia were both attacked this was even before the curfewive read the bible from cover to cover several times i still ca not quote most of it but im pretty sure it says somewhere in there that its easier to fit trumps orange ass through eye of a needle than his chances of getting into heavenas the gets arrested the will stop now its up to the judges and i do not have to much faith in that part of the system after seeing a slime ball like dc mass riots end as trump military restore order in nations capital trump is a rapistdonald trump is a pedophiledonald trump is racistdonald trump is a misogynistdonald trump is homophobic donald trump is sexistdonald trump is xenophobicif you do not see the issue here please educate yourself the country people are protesting systemic racism and police brutality and trump is calling on governors to silence them with mass arrests long prison sentences and surveillance this is the response of an autocrat from the time stamp its clear that haley tweeted that as trumps speech began the lack of a followup suggests that she did not love the speech but is too cowardly to say sothis incident reminds me of stories ive read and seen of kind hearted people hiding jewish families in their homes from the nazis on the streets this dark time im staying optimistic that the goodness of people will prevail that these democrat governors will not do anything to stop the riots in their cities the news cries for president trump to do something now all of a sudden because he is the only responsible only attempting to stop the burning and looting of cities he is a dictator my mother used to always say they carry their bibles because you ca not tell theyre christians by their behavior theres nothing christlike about what trump doesif you wanted to fight trumps propaganda you might consider not disseminating every picture from every stunt like the biblechurch thingor do what he wants and share the picture he wants disseminated and frame the dialogue exactly how he wants ityour choicewatching republicans praising trump threatening to send the military into us cities to attack protesting americans is maddening wrote a letter to send to senators and representatives urging them to take action and defend us before trump really gets the violence goingplease rt the letter please send it to your senrep is the type of american i know from more than year of living in the usa ive never met anyone like donald trump and never want to do so spending much of yesterday tweeting from the white house us president donald trump has emerged to deliver an ultimatum to the american people catalan and french protesters were beaten by police guy made no such signal of his virtuebecause his condemnation or support is conditional on tribal allegiancesif you are in his tribe beat away but if you are in another tribe he soon finds his voicereminder in a year of hong kong protests china never killed protestors attacked journalists or deployed military in a week the us has done all of this president xi left the issue to hk government to resolve trump has overridden state officials who is authoritariankremlin has iron clad control of the senatemarco rubio mitch mcconnell donald trump and lindsey graham campaigns took million from an oligarch linked to russia they are well compromised and no longer represent the interest of the united states during gezi protests in june they the protesters have entered the mosque with shoes drunk alcohol inside it yesterday these thugs protesters have burned the bibledear trumploving hypocritesyou will not wear a mask because it infringes on some huge freedom but youre absolutely fine w trump sending the military into cities want to save lives wear the mask keep the military out never vote for trump againokay so i saw something just now that the military is planning to use real bullets against protestors tonight at the protest at the white house trump is legally allowed too i do not know if its a rumor but id rather not take that chance and just tell yall to be carefulbtw i have attended services in st john the evangelist episcopalian chuchni in lafayette square washington dc and not surprised they are appalled at trumps tear gassed brutality in clearing the protestors for his bible waving stunt are honored to have the support of in our race to take back new york is excited to join president trump in the great american comeback is just inches away from a martial lawtrump deploys the army but if the state governors refuse to allow the army in their states then trump has a constitutional right to impose a martial law across americaarmy will take overeveryone talking about trump holding the bible upside down in horror movies you always know that the demonic presence is nearby when the crosses on the wall start to pivot upside down look i do not make the demonic rules i just point them outtrump is and always has been a moral issue what contempt i have for every politician and journalist who has ever tried to ingratiate themselves to him or even strained to be evenhanded did not need to say anything most religious leaders use a time like that to try to impress with flowery words the picture of holding the bible paints words trump now officially blaming white anarchists this is an antiblack divide and conquer narrative and if you got swept up in it in it at any point in the last week you need to take a break and think about why donald trump agrees with youtrump gassed our clergy and hurt peaceful protesters so he could use the church as a political prop the word abomination exists for behavior like this bangs are scary rubber bullets are scary tear gas is scary military choppers are scary covid is scary unemployment is scary food insecurity is scary all the sirens im hearing are scary barr is scary putin is scary republicans are scary but most scary trumpblack people are not happy right now white people are not happy right now hell donald trump is not even happy right now but you know who is vladimir putin oh he is getting one hell of a return on his investment dave batista calls jaxson ryker of the forgotten sons a sorry ass motherfucker for supporting donald trump antifa is being used by trump regime to divide black from white protesters in other words genuine from anarchists that these protests are largely multiracial is a massive threat to the state in flames its economy already in ruins trump is the best investment putin has ever made tucker carlson called out trump last nightthe president reassured america that he and his family were safe he did not mention protecting the rest of the nation much of which was then on fire he seemed aware only of himselftrump just lost tucker carlsonpeople replying about insurrection act that act can only be passed through congress from what has been said trump does not plan on waiting on congress therefore making it illegal america under marshal lawprotestors on its streetsjournalists arrested dead million ill out of workthe economy tankedtrump wants a photo opwelcome to one by one we the people will arrest agbarr trump his crime family his crime administration wilbur ross who runs trumps laundromat prison is waiting members of congress governors what are you going to do to stop trumps lawlessness martial law and theocracyplease tell me you have a plan beyond ripping up his speech and clapping sideways as we descend into dictatorshiphey why did not you cover bidens events today i wanted to see them we need a leader since trump is not onefuck george will and the bowtie he rode in on you want to destroy the right and empower the left because you do not like trump fuck you you nambypamby hasbeen who never conserved a single thing in all his time in the political arena words words words so many useless wordsdonald trump is literally ripping this country apart if you still choose to ignore it i have nothing to say to you you are blind to what his actions are causingmy hood like many others got destroyed by looters and fascists using a crime executed in a democratic city as the excuse and this moron thinks trump is declaring war on america is he sick stupid or both thats too bad i liked i wonder what pithy social media posts can be used to spin this its actually wendys taco bell and pizza hut he runs btw vote with your wallet yall price surges to as trump threatens military crackdownfollow us on twitter or telegram to keep up with the latest news in the crypto space trump declared war on american citizens to hell with november he is unfit to lead and must be removed from office now is hiding ca not do a coherent speech he looked terrible at nasa ppl at his stage of dementia do not realize how bad they look in public kush saying lay low means they see his impairment as a big liability resigning is a reality coming at them that they still ca not facecan i get this straight the police teargassed a crowd protesting against police violence to clear a space so trump could stand like a constipated centaur in highheels and and say protesters were wrong to protest against police violence seems extremely nonpoliceviolencya few days ago twitter censored one of trumps tweets for glorifying violence and now we have countless examples of street violence being glorified on twitter will not be censored though because the standard was always subjective and never legitimately enforceablesome police listened walked with protesters or even prayed with them they are americas heroesothers fed the hate that causes violence or committed violence themselves they are trumps heroes you choose it ca not be both the photo of trump standing in front of a boarded up church holding a bible upside down be the photo that wikipedia uses cuz it says so much in one photoas trump declares actual war on us citizens johnson strips rights from and prepares to impose economic sanctions on uk citizens and both of them needlessly kill tens of thousands with rank incompetence i think we can conclude that chubby blond populists are fucking bad newsdisgusting donald trump had respectful and peaceful protesters violently removed for a photo op our leaders in washington have failed us did not forget about mike brown snowden manning wikileaks drone war should we continueyou expanded the surveillance state just like trump the difference the mainstream media liked youhes gonna use the military against people who are for the most part protesting peacefully in order to end the violence caused by riot police and police brutalitytrump giving governors tips he picked up in epsteins mansion ps this tough guy spent the night hiding in the wh bunker with the lights off this is why trump is incapable of hearing s peaceful protest and in fact raged against ittrump is a rapistnever forget thati am your president of law and order trump says in the rose garden as protesters are teargassed by the police just blocks away maga mantrump stands strong at saint

unemploymentfrustration casued by covid fueled by administrations trump failure to address the issue swiftly and responsibly plus democratic and other intereststrump just mentioned protecting second amendment rights in an address about taking strong action against riotersthis is a loud fucking dog whistlethe president tried to prove he was tough by ordering volleys of tear gas and rubber bullets to be fired on peacefully assembled americans in the process he reminded us the kind of person he is and it has nothing to do with toughnesspresident trump has primed this protest moment to devolve into a violent act to fill the streets with the military creates the possibility of a spark that will explode with more violence and death vigilante groups with baseball bats roaming the streets of philadelphia violencesorry we have to play alternative headlines trump believes america needs a good cry sends tear gas canisters to help trump promises help for cities facing covid negroes promises

a shield to validate your hideous action this man does not represent christ or the principles of god he does not represent christian in any way and any one who believes he does is a lunatic and do not know the heart of godgov charlie baker rma gets emotional when talking about trumps calls to dominate protesters when the country needed compassion it was simply nowhere to be found of the

just as quickly turning around and criticising him nowim in touch with someone whos on the governors call with president trump right now they and others listening in are alarmed the president is urging governors to take back the streets not be weak and use force as the nation faces growing racial unrestremember trump said white supremacists nazis kkk and alt right in charlottesville were very

is murdered by police after another black man was lynched by racists and trumps response is to target the left with police and militarywhybecause the left stands with blacks and trumps white nationalism ca not have thatpresident trump is projected to add more than trillion to the national debt for the fiscal years through that could swell by another trillion if lawmakers pass another round of covid stimulus legislation as has been rumoredtrump was a psyop to turn a generation of dispossessed young men into neoconservative shills who watch fox news and get a case of the vapors over a memo or a press briefing that will never amount to anythingthe arc of the moral universe may be long but it bends towards justice mlk jr change is slow but there must be hope despair suits the

looters they have hijacked the message and are giving trump plenty of ammunition and maybe thats the point of outside agitatorsfocus must be kept on the coldblooded murder of george floyd and the systemic racism in law enforcementpolice reinforced by national guard troops forcefully pushed back protesters near the white house to clear a way for pres trump to visit a church just minutes after he said he wanted a military show of force against violent protests gripping the country am loving watching the collapse of american exceptionalism if theres one thing trumps presidency has inadvertently done well its bring american hypocrisy to the fore i love it he declared a dictatorship thats what just happened hes declared hes turning the army on us krystalball the president is declaring war on american citizens trumps disaster is an unforced error he stepped into a strong economy and a nation with a strong position internationally plans were in place for dealing with pandemics and police reform trump took all of this and broke it for his own glory reports from the white house are saying trump was upset about the news reports of him hiding in a bunker and wanted to be seen walking out the white house front door and down the street what a little man cooper blurts out oh my god after learning the real reason for donald trumps deranged military stunt via is ultimately what the president is not processing until he really addresses police reform as the first part of any other statement the protests will not stopi have often said that trump would kill us all rather than be embarassed thats what his photo op and attacking the protesters and implementing the insurrection act is about his embarrasment over being mocked for going into the wh bunker s no protection for anyone anymore you will die are tear gassing protesters without any regard to the effects on people with covid the first time i experienced tear gas was at a portland protest after

condemn racism and hatred that the education act was signed into law thank you to for your leadership this important legislation will ensure we teach future generations about the can say trump is racist condemn the systemic killing of black people by the us police support the black lives matter movement aaaand also address systemic racism in aotearoa beyond ironic that trump let the governors deal with a killer of over but now when they do not need his ham fisted help he is gleeful about sending in federal troops beyond shameful he needs to be removed from officethis incompetent fool is calling out trump while it sounds like the purge is happening outside my window in midtown manhattan and friends are sending me photos of all the looting they are watching at street level across the city protesters gathered outside the white house on friday night the secret service rushed trump to the underground bunker beneath the executive mansion previously used during terror threats maddow

bullets and teargassed peaceful protesters outside the white house to clear the path for president trump to visit st johns church lewis once said when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross told governors in a conference call today that rioters must be arrested and tried and they have to go to jail for long periods of time or until kim kardashian lets them outthe bible has long been one of the most dangerous books in the world and never more so than when its wielded as a prop by racistsweve been moving in this direction every day of trumps presidency but that does not make this moment any less terrifying it is absolutely terrifyingtrump and many republicans just praised armed protesters in michigan a few weeks ago they claimed to believe in freedom liberty now theyve completely flipped their standard are supporting a rank authoritarian crackdown bc theyre ideologically opposed to these protestersjesus wishes the american people the best

to be clear when putin orders trump to act and trump orders to act it means the are technically russian agents release the trump putin call or resign we will not be ruled from the kremlin swift to donald trump after stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence we will vote you out in november going to be brutally honest i do not know what to do right nowi have not lived through something like thisi do know im not going to quit despite people who are desperately trying to stop usim going to fight trumps agenda and for what is righti need you to helpobamabacked fbi entrap general flynn russia investigation was a hoax impeachment inquiry against trump was unlawful democrats got insane now they are using antifa terrorists to take down trumpimportant to notethis was a peaceful protest there was no rioting there was no violence until police fired tear gas and rubber bullets on american citizens to disperse them before president trump made a speech the president did not just put dem governors mayors and antifa on noticehe also intends to investigate members of congress and political organizations that have supported and or funded the antifathis president means businesses it ok to love your presidentcan you imagine the angelic realm protecting him if only we had eyes to see pray for trump president trump just endorsed the idea of using air assault operations on us citizens how can anyone be ok with this could work we have to remember though clinton had problems bush is remembered for invading iraq then we have trumps base birthers fox all against obama maybe the wives could do it including this latest oneso neither jacinda ardern nor todd muller would say donald trump was racist but the pm declined to say it in a way that was smoother and deployed less staringi fuking hate trump but this obama nostalgia is getting on my nerves the national guard was also deployed during the occupy protests in that protesters at standing rock were met with contracted mercs attack dogs fire hoses in this is the guy who as an experiment tweets exactly what trump tweets to see what do about it he was suspendedus black people have had to resist the state longer than four years their entire lives and not out of choice the protests are not a political rally or an issue that can be resolved with an election or removing trump we need a complete overhaul of the systemtrump called for mayors governors to dominate the streetsordered federal police to fire tear gas rubber bullets at peaceful protestorsthen held up bible to declare himself our law order presidenthe is dangerous inflammatory when america needs leadership healingterrific point from on cnn the protesters we all just saw are not looters theyre young people who are full of idealism and want to make a statement thats wholly legitimate we all saw that on national tv and trumps magical lying powers ca not make that disappeartrump has just made completely explicit that he wants armed forces police and military to dominate the american people that is the essential nature of fascismpolice aggressively cleared protesters outside the white house before trump walked to st johns church for a photo opportunity bible in hand ppl can gaze upward w their eyes while moving their head back to see upward trump ca not do either w his ftd its almost like the need to look up initiated an involuntary jerk backwards he then seemed disoriented like he jumped off a swing he should be wearing a helmeti like my white supremacists honest like this trump makes it clear preserving the status quo is it this is about forcing them to live under oppressionhe might as well have just come out and said if you ca not dominate these darkies you ai not white protestors by the white house were tear gassed and shot with rubber bullets so the president could not have a photo op at a church fuck donald trump and if u support his trash ass unfollow me my heart is broken watching the news here was the us view of the unprovoked sucker punch to the face from the cop what insanity all so trump can clear the square for a photo op in front of a church while teargasing its priests my sons pharmacy in sacramento was attacked last night the windows were shattered youre not doing a damn thing but mocking trump bring in the militaryyoure a failure as governor like you were as mayor of sfi think i get blindsided by twitter because im always like yes people are sharing my views and the community is huge but really its not when racism still exists and people like trump are in power we need to get the message out further thats why we need these protestspresident trump holds a bible outside of a burned st johns church this is one of those powerful photos that will last throughout history are deploying the united states military against your own people and that is the act of a dictator civil war is now inevitable and you will not win trump ran a series of attack ads against native american casinos alleging with no proof that they were guilty of crimes trump fired a black contestant from the apprentice for being overeducated sycophantic lapdog watercarrier mediathats how was elected chairman of the idu is this what you want your democracy in canada to becomethink about what youre doing think about the shame your children will feel knowing what youve done future generations will remember trump and his supporters as todays nazis its time to decide if youre going to be on the right side of history said nothing literally nothing in condemnation of daily and brutal police attacks on in france about which you could have done something given your exalted position you utter rampant hypocrite bishop at dc church outraged by trump visit i just ca not believe what my eyes have seen you talk about going back to normal obamas normalyour batshit crazytrump has been the best president in historyyou and all of your dirty cohorts being paid off by soros to do his bidding can go to hellyou have been part of the problem for too longbishop budde comments on president trumps visit to st johns episcopal church he was proceeded by a violent clearing of nonviolent protesters to make his way and he was using our church as a backdrop and the bible as a prop god bless all who have been helping during this time pass your stories forward so we can continue the chain of information of violence agitated by trumpas trump stokes the flames of racial hatred and orders violence against his own people and nick ferrari ask the most pressing question on this nd june did barack obama let down black americanstrump threatens to use the insurrection act declare martial and deploy the army against protesters what us imperialism has done globally is being deployed against its own people stop going to movies let these scum feel the pain most of these small bussinesses are now facing they support these criminals and pay their bail could have waited until pm when the protestors would have been in technical violation of the curfew and scheduled the gassing for thenofficers could have refused a blatantly illegal order to had a lawful assembly at for no reason these little tests have meaningi firmly believe covid did not work as planned for the dems so this race war was the next in their box of goodies to oust trump they will burn down the country in order to take it backnot once in his perverted despot speech did trump address police brutality racism or murder that is all you need to know he does not care there was absolutely zero effort to communicate and negotiate with that child just sheer brutality woven into their psyche fuck them new laws must be passed when trump is out and they must be first on the listthe fact that just weeks ago white people were on the streets protesting with weapons in hand just to break the stay at home order over a haircut and he did not go to great lengths to stop them now hes calling on the military to stop a peaceful protestyou see the problemmore president trump just berated governors and mayors for how they are handling the protests calling them fools per person on the calltrump outside of st johns churchreporter is that your bibletrump its a bible ive really never seen anyone look more uncomfortable holding a bible they did not hide this either trump declared his intentions before he was president bannon never pretended he wanted snugging other than destructionhundreds of newspaper editorial boards called for clinton and nixon the resign but newspapers are not calling for trumps resignation my latest piece investigates why it reveals a lot about our politics todaysoin less than like minutes of just scrolling my feed i witnessed a black dude on his knees pleading with officers singled out and roughly arrested a radio order from trump to kill on sight the officer broadcasting it says for every nigger for mexicanspresident trump uses teargas and rubber bullets against peaceful protesters not rioters to make a public statement outside a church holding a biblewhen the head of state does this things are really bad single day since protests began the authorities have escalated giving people more of a reason to protest and now trump just escalated even bigger they want clashes they want the drama and the violence and the polarization its like they want a race warjohnson not in power for a year yet has created divisionhatredmistrust loathing we are running headlong into the state americas in he is another trump power mad with zero humilitycarerespecttrust we need to get him out before it escalatesand it willtrump is unable to take responsibility for what hes done and have not done enough and he will never apologizedo not expect him to back down expect him to escalate lord fartandannoy has overstepped bigtime this is not an insurrection its simply a protest his photo op was juvenile got people hurt to feel important grossly disgusting i alone can fix it donald j trump july th accepting the s nomination for president of the united states members reject trumps bid to bring russia in from the cold citing russias aggressive destabilizing activity that threatens collective security of our allies russias continued disrespect flaunting of international rules did not know they had the bible in the s i thought trump was only one who had one crazy the similarities between the two leaders trump walking to st johns church which was set on fire with bible in hand was a direct message for atheist george sorosyoure not going to beat god me or the united states of america earlier today trump pulled his best alassad and tear gassed his own citizens just so he could have a photo op disgusting was mentally failing but he was not a cowardbill clinton was unfaithful but he is not a cowardg w bush is an idiot but he is not a cowardtrump is a mentally failing unfaithful idiotand a coward who hides in his bunker and tear gasses protesters for a photo optheres a pandemic that has killed americans and jobs in america due largely to federal government incompetence and its only the second worst thing about trumps presidencyand in the united states antifa have never killed anyone unlike their enemies in klan hoods and squad cars do not understand how so many people can still support trump especially those who claim to be christians there have been so many instances brought to light of him being sexist racist etc yet you turn a blind eye just because i do not get itmaybe it was actually bad when obama helped preserve and expand bushs panopticon that could be handed over to someone like donald trump they cleared out this peaceful protest so trump could get his camera time and march himself into the church next door this was all for optics and all it shows is that trump is willing to ignore americans rights and human rights just so he can look good a real newspaper would have a headline and lede like as peaceful protestors are gassed trump plans military rulethe president spoke to vladimir putin earlier today and this authoritarian move is straight out of his playbooksisolak condemns trumps suggestion of unilaterally sending troops to states to quell unrestvia please please read up on the cult of the shining city by holding up a bible in front of a church

violent clearing of nonviolent protesters to make his way and he was using our church as a backdrop and the bible as a prop in ways that i found to be deeply offensive he even makes his daughter uncomfortable johnson should front up in parliament today and condemn president trump in the strongest possible way but he will not because hes a spineless huckster who is responsible for many racist tropes in the past populism sticks together trump has gained another followers in less than days yes i have follower envykeep it up folks i love this presidentamazing how nigerians see trump in the comments comparing a raging bull like trump to tired if you like lifeless buharitrumps only weakness is that he talks too much and is petty anywaysif you do not speak out against the actions of then you are supporting the actions of donald trump are clearly not on the side of americansplease please please watch the jeffrey epstein filthy rich documentary on netflix donald trump bill clinton and prince andrew are all rapists they were all close with epstein and raped girls as young as trump paid for print ads calling for the execution of five black teenagers the central park who had been wrongly accused of a series of violent crimes in central park even after dna evidence proved their innocence trump said last year they were still guilty is what the democrats want they want to scare people and destroy this countrywe cannot let america fall so the governors and mayors should step up and stop people from burning down our country if not then trump will save us and the country trumps move towards overt facism continues for all to see but his threat of using the military is in direct contravention of the posse comitatus act of he does not seem to care any more to hide his increasingly dictator like tendenciesthis incompetent fool is calling out trump while it sounds like the purge is happening outside my window in midtown manhattan and friends are sending me photos of all the looting they are watching at street level across the cityi look forward to every fact checker in the media giving big pinocchios for this whopper of a lie that he called for a nationwide lockdown in january trump any president can stay in power for as long as he or she wants do whatever he or she wants with a stroke of a pen yes a dictatorship in the united states completely legal in the eyes of the us constitution and world and nobody can save you but yourselvesboomoann reporter chanel rion to kayleigh mcenany will trump administration investigate members of congress for support or ties to antifa video via m whiteim britishim straightim a racistim a racisti support the militaryim a racistim a racistim a racistim uneducatedi love animalsim a christianim a racistyou guys i am really mad about trump using the insurrection act to disperse peaceful protesters and about a million other things but i literally lold at thisreporter is that your bibletrump its a bible today rather than standing with peaceful protestors who are demanding change declared war against his own people he has made america grieve again and does not deserve to hold the title of president of the united states think right now more than ever is important to speak up speak up for the black lives speak up for the sexually assaulted this is a big fuck you to donald trump not only are you a smug idiot but you are also a racist and rapist hell has a special place for youpictured trump and jeffrey epstein both now confirmed child rapists please do not let this go ignored mcconnell confirming more judges as the nation is literally bleeding with the votes of the same senators who refused to convict trump at his impeachment trial gov jb pritzker labeled president donald trump a miserable failure as nationwide protests have intensified over the death of george floyd apparently trump arranged for peaceful protesters outside the white house to be tear gassed this was so he could walk unhindered to a church after his televised speech in which he threatened to quell protests with us military force those are both things that fascists do unfortunately democrats were hoping for something like this to happen they do not grieve for floyd they are happy that the man died so they can blame it on trump and destroy the country i just saw a tweet from bho they do not care if president trump wins theyre going after the house senate that will lock this country into socialism with their new laws we cant let them win at the local state level everyone vot redchanel rion continues to be the only honest reporter in the reporter to will administration investigate members of congress for support or ties to antifa every fucking thing trump et al have done since before he was inaugurated is illegal but when you have an entire party of republicans in congress who are cowards and traitors it doesnt matter vote every republican out of officei was outraged that he felt that he had the license to do that and that he would abuse our sacred symbols and our sacred space in that way rev mariann edgar budde said of president trump holding up a bible outside st johns church priest on trump photoop using the bible as a prop while talking about sending in the military bragging about how your country is the greatest in the world and publicly mocking people on a daily basis is pretty much the opposite of all jesus stood forim not among those who love bashing the which i consider our frontline defense against tyranny but this headline is stunningly bad totally missing what may be the most chilling day in the trump presidency yep trump just had a phone call with putin today did not putin hail himself as a law order leader during chaos he created himself black panthers this is exactly what is scared of when the blacks unites we are in destructible we are strong trump spoke about invoking the insurrection act of which was used in the past but the point is he wants to invoke it again it is not currently passed during this timetypo but he talked about it this should alarm u take precaution mexican flags in our faces throwing rocks at the horses damaged police cars starting fires it was a riot look it up it made national news from that point on i became a trump supporter i never posted about it or anything because i was afraid of the back flash xdisenfranchising bame mp on today of all days all mps need to stand together against this vital that basic human values fundamental democratic principles trump party politics there is only one man standing between us and total anarchy in america president trump hope everybody understands that at least nowgiven trumps bible photoop today worth reupping this hilarious viral clip from where he gave away the fact that hes never read a single line from itthis is the visual that will define the entire failed trumpian experiment when his country needed a leader donald trump turned off the lights and hid under the bed team trump online with and text trump to new poll done has tied with in south carolina at oh boy what fun it would be to knock off one of the most pathetic trump sycophantslets get it done the day that donald trump literally threatens to use the us army to shoot people of colour demonstrating against racist extra judicial killings by police why would s big question of the day be did obama live up to his promises donald trump we are with you first australians downunder maga walked among the protesting crowd at the lincoln memorial trump had people tear gassed so he could get a photo op both are crooks nixon had couragethat whole line where people try to equate the moral failings of trump biden by saying at least trump never started any wars is going to age real bad if the military opens fire on us citizens certain segments of leftist twitter may want to adjust their post histories nowtrump is deploying the military on his own people trump says he will deploy the us military if state officials fail to quell protests you are white and placing blame squarely on trump for this rash of police violence i want you to consider the democratic governors who have funded and deployed these statesanctioned militias your presidential candidate whose first suggestion was that these militias merelyone of the reasons i am being hardassed about asking the protesters to observe the curfew and deprive trump of oxygen is because i know that trumps entire play in november is to shoot for an electoral college win and a popular vote loss its his only play i do not choose i choose america and trump which is why i will vote to reelect him in november he has consistently put america firsti know i should not add oxygen but i am just so fcking angry about this tweet utterly disgusting weasel of a man licking the ase of trump having fcked up this country with racism he is endorsing it in america toowhen matt gaetz is not getting arrested for drunk driving or attempting to intimidate a federal witness hes advocating for the extrajudicial killing of american citizensyou can donate to his opponent here weeks ago trump praised armed protesters in michigan but today he orders the us military to shoot peaceful protesters across from the rose garden with rubber bullets and tear gas the difference hes using our military to harm his political opponents trump stop the chinese coup
