"@thegriffster @MarilynEgan1 @JoeBiden @CNN @MSNBC @NBCNews @ABC @CBSNews Yes, #DictatorTrump shoul not be opening his mouth one bit about ""Sleepy Joe"". Biden is giving the American people what they need, hearing them and showing compassion."
"The speech has now broadened from a condemnation of Trump's rhetoric and tactics, to a broader policy-specific blueprint for what Biden wants to see."
"The Hunter Biden contract was a classic example of influence peddling. Even if it is shown that his father's actions were unrelated, it would be good to establish the full facts, just as I favored the investigation of Trump on Ukraine.  https://t.co/Kig1Ht0LcL"

We can't make right the cruelties by police against black people by electing Biden. It doesn't matter if Bernie refuses to take his place. He must be made to. We poured heart ; soul into his candidacy because he spoke the language of revolution. He owes it to us now to guide one.

"Fifth one . . .1. Russia2. Ukraine3. Covid (they are working on articles of impeachment)4. Antifa and BLM's planned riots (they will be working on articles of impeachment)5. Racist Obama to speak on race and indicate HE will ACTUALLY be president, not Senile Joe Biden"
"Just like with coronavirus, Trump is going to get tired of the protest storyline too. He'll declare victory and move on soon. He just wants to talk about his great economy and how terrible Joe Biden is so he can get re-elected."
"your money is better spent by giving to your local bail fund or orgs that provide legal rep for those in the system. you can also look into orgs/institutions (such as a public school or local library) that provides social services like food drives, after-school programs, etc"

This is your daily reminder that Hunter Biden scored a $1.5 BILLION deal with the CCP after flying there on Air Force 2That is on top of $3.1 million from BurismaHis dad is now the presumptive Democrat nomineeWhy isn't the media camped out at Biden HQ demanding answers?🤔
Pls don't vote for Bernie when we all know he is not going to win. We need to unify and get Trump out. That's the main priority. Biden is more likely to win so we will vote for Biden.

"Fuck you, goat man. Also. Because you're an uneducated POS, the party platforms changed in the early 1900's. Lincoln would've fallen among democratic lines right now. Not republican lines."
"*Not* likening Trump to Bernie, but Trump's *electoral strategy* of trying to win with a minority through the electoral college is not unlike Bernieworld's plan to win the primary with a minority in a split field. Bernie lost to Biden's more traditional campaign. Trump next?"

@fleccas I'm confused... I thought churches weren't allowed to be open...people weren't allowed to congregate and masks had to be over your nose and mouth? But here wer have Joe Biden in a church with people and he's clearly protecting his chin. 🤦‍♀️

"Whenever I talk econ to smart kids like this, they always raise questions about sustainable growth and intuitively get that GDP fails to capture (worse, it counts it as growth) the enviro damage we do. We need to nurture/channel that skepticism!"
@tvmanoise @MarcyBones64 And to think Biden is still riding those coattails. He was SPECIFICALLY picked because his record would help assuage the fears of white moderates who were uncomfortable with a black man that talked like a socialist.
"@dfsparks @bhaviklathia You seem happy with the status quo.  ""Nothing will fundamentally change"" remains Joe Biden's mantra.Maybe you never really cared about poor people too begin with."
