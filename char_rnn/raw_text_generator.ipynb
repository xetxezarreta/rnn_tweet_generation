       "'in the face of ongoing nationwide protests trump administration deploys military to the capital lights that usually illuminate the white house have been shut off as regime leader trump takes shelter inside im not trying to brag about my skills at predicting im saying that what trump is was always obvious and anybody who voted for him should be understood as being profascist from the getgo nobody gets to say they did not know trumps comment that he was going to activate bill barr makes me wonder whether our attorney general when his staff goes home on friday just powers down at his desk for the weekend this is sad and nobody is doing anything about this so heres a list of companies supporting trumps reelection bang inn n out chick fil a taco bell mcdonalds wendys kfc pizza hut olive garden waffle house ihop carls jrso if you see me starting to get thinner and toned do not ask me why law order in philadelphia now they are looting stores call in our great national guard like they finally did thank you president trump last night in minneapolis is this what voters want with sleepy joe all dems its my bad though the way america mishandled covid should have been enough to radicalize every single one of us but that was a relatively slow burn donald trump just declared war on us that will do it expeditiously words from our own president four months ago what an example donald trump is basically begging to be photoshopped after he stood outside this church with a bible send us yours and we will round up the funniest i blame democrats for this shit going on in all the citiesbut i blame republicans as well being pussies not standing up to the democrats for being weak and letting democrats ruin our country yes i know blame both parties for this lawlessness trump bring out military so trump calls out the military to teargas peaceful protesters for a photo op in front of a church holding a bibleno political motivation was theredo we wake up to martial law tomorrow is this guy all good he always answers like hes scared to piss someone off like he does not wanna fuck his white sunday lines lol thread president trump says these protests are professionally organized and the result of domestic terrorists and anarchists based on my reporting on the ground today the vast majority of people gathering outside of the white house are everyday americans demanding change when people stand up for their rights and autocrats have no other option they always play the religion card holding the quran holding the bible what will response to trump be tomorrowas bold and firm as it has been opposing the tories the corona virus pandemic catastrophe who can expect cuomo or de blasio to do anythingthey have important work to do like criticizing trumps tone silly me i thought a line was crossed when rioters started looting and burning cities to the ground trump did not start this but hes going to end it in the uk the foreign secretary will not comment on trump in australia a news crew is attacked by the us police and the prime minister gets involved immediately spot the difference yet he did not give me an opportunity to even speak george floyds brother philonise floyd described how his conversation with donald trump wentit was hardhe just kept like pushing me off like i do not want to hear what youre talking about this is why there is a silent majority who hates these far left actual racists trump more years and you will never know that your coworker and people sitting next to you on a train or in a line at a store are voting for trump i pray for a new day in our nation when we have eradicated these plagues that we face covid and racism chicagos mayor lori lightfoot calls out pres trump for inciting violence and trying to inflame racist urges for political gain i find it rather preposterous that people who vehemently condemn general buharis government its decisions and mannerisms are vehemently supporting donald trump even as he appears to be reading from the playbook of nigerias leadership style the hypocrisy can make one purge donald trumpthreatened war crimes on irandownplayed the pandemic while forcing all whitehouse staff to get tested dailydisrespected several fallen veteransthreatened to kill his own citizens utilizing their right to protesthas several rape accusations against him piers morgan he failed to protect america from covid now a cowardly president fuels the fires and fiddles in his bunker as america burns with rage at george floyds despicable murder by police shame on you mr trump just because kamala calls trump a dictator she is suddenly a hero when she exploited the systemic racism to jail hundreds of black and brown people liberals are just as much idiots as conservatives donald trump is going to be so pissed that our video will still have more views and we did not need tear gas to make it he knows exactly what hes doing he knows that the worlds largest armed underground white supremacist movement will gladly work alongside the worlds largest military rd largest police force to kill incarcerate otherwise brutalize protestors this is horrifying is not late jan feb when biden said it was racist for donald trump to shut down travel from the epicenter of the viral outbreak im fairly certain he was not advocating for locking down america while simultaneously not wanting to lock down travel from the origin of the virus secret revealed this is how trump was put to win in even the fbi agent knew itbut he will not manage to win again in mark this tweet were legions trump had peaceful protestors tear gassed so he could have a photo opthe lord tests the righteous but his soul hates the wicked and the one who loves violence psalm long after i assume room temp and join jesus historians are gonna have a field day with i certainly hope that president trump is given the honor he deserves in defending america and the left is represented with a jaundiced eye and a sigh of disgust for their evil actions donald trump was denounced by the leadership of the church he used for a photoop after having innocent people tear gassed so he could walk across the street unencumbered by protests dictatorstyle amnesty responds to trumpthe us system of policing is broken and needs systemic reform to root out racism the president swore an oath to the nation to protect all of its people not just those he deems worthy fuck the laws of your nation rich white son of an racist oligarch raping and stealing and invading other nations becomes presidentpoor black guy who allegedly paid with a fake dollar bill gets tortured and killed by police an entirely peaceful protest was gathering outside the white house on monday night when it was broken up with a volley of tear gas and some of the most aggressive policing i have yet seen here writes in washington rev mariann budde the episcopal bishop of washington was seething mad when she spoke to the about teargassing peaceful protesters for a staged photo op in front of her church there are signs overnight of military preparations possibly to back up president trumps threat to use regular military forces as opposed to national guard against those on the streets tonight trump ordered an assault on protestors with rubber bullets and tear gas so he could stand in front of a church and hold up the bible clearly he has no sense of what is in the good bookthings like love peace and reconciliation trump is a lesson to all tbr free worlds regardless of the laws or how strong institutions are one useless president can bring back the dark ages one useless president thats what they did trump shooting people in their homes and you bless them for what theyve done speak but do not shoutwalk in peace but do not vandalizeand remember the nightmare of covid is real so avoid crowding president trump walking to st johns church right now is the most powerful thing ive seen a president do in my lifetimeamerica wont stand for anarchy and tyranny this violence and terrorism ends now defense officials tell cnn there was growing discomfort among some in the pentagon even before trump announced that he is ready to deploy the military to enforce order inside the united states trumps gujarat event responsible for virus crisis in mumbai sanjay rautraut alleged that the event held in ahmedabad to welcome trump in feb was responsible for the spread of coronavirus in gujarat later in mumbai and delhi west point cadets who trump forced back to school so he could give a speech have now tested positive for the coronavirus if my tweet made trump supporters feel marginalized stereotyped or prejudged thats how black people have felt for hundreds of yearsthey have to deal w unspeakable atrocities a rigged system holding them down remember that next time u bitch about tweets what erdoan did in to be elected as president declared state of emergency staged a fake coup and called it later a gift from good detainedeliminated political opponents detained journalists maybe trump will do it like erdoan isnt it funny how trump was calling mexicans rapists yet he turned out to be raping abusing little boys and girls this whole time sir was really projecting his own insecurities onto minorities i will never understand how so many hispanics support that piece of shit do better resisters good morning these are stressing times for us i hope everyone is well try to have patience watch trumphe is destroying himself trump is digging his own hole it looks he will fall in pull the dirt in on himself black lives matter free uyghur muslims in china free palestine israel does not exist fuck trump black lives matter free uyghur muslims in china free palestine israel does not exist fuck trump just reported that trump did this because he was upset about coverage of him being taken to a bunkerwanted people to see him walking out of the white house dear military you took an oath to support and defend the constitution and to protect the country from all enemies foreign and domestic trump ordered you to use military force to clear peaceful protesters from a park that was an illegal order what is your duty here hmm the federal government launched tear gas at protestors who were peaceably assembled to petition the government for a redress of grievances there was no curfew in place these were not looters it would be difficult for trump to violate the constitution more directly the proud boys is a terrorist organizationthe nra is a terrorist organizationthe gop is a terrorist organizationthe trump family is a terrorist organizationyou ca not tell me otherwise while we are distracted boris johnson is selling britain to trump nhs up for sale chlorinated chicken on its way making a deal with the president who is burning everything in his path nigel farage demands meeting with eu to warn against brexit delay do you get the impression that nigel is feeling a bit of a spare part perhaps trump could find a use for him we certainly ca not in memory of my great aunts who were killed in the holocaust i denounce donald trump the racistinchief trump is no longer the the states are not unitedwhy is he fuelling the fire and not calling for calmhe is going to try to delay the election as trump speaks in rose garden this is the scene north of white house split in half and continue to be pushed minutes from curfew president is responding to the by urging all governors to call out the he threatened to send the us to states that did not comply these are the acts of a achhe din sarkaars chronologycoronatrumpdelhi riotstaali bajaounplannd lckdwnlkhs of joblosses as s of inds shtdwnlkhs of migrnts strt thr homesmany do not make it helping nonefuel prices hikelpg cylinder hike assault on journalists near white house by federal police clearing the way for trump to get his photoop in front of a church holding a bible the cameraman and reporter from australia were both attacked this was even before the curfew ive read the bible from cover to cover several times i still ca not quote most of it but im pretty sure it says somewhere in there that its easier to fit trumps orange ass through eye of a needle than his chances of getting into heaven as the gets arrested the will stop now its up to the judges and i do not have to much faith in that part of the system after seeing a slime ball like dc mass riots end as trump military restore order in nations capital donald trump is a rapistdonald trump is a pedophiledonald trump is racistdonald trump is a misogynistdonald trump is homophobic donald trump is sexistdonald trump is xenophobicif you do not see the issue here please educate yourself across the country people are protesting systemic racism and police brutality and trump is calling on governors to silence them with mass arrests long prison sentences and surveillance this is the response of an autocrat from the time stamp its clear that haley tweeted that as trumps speech began the lack of a followup suggests that she did not love the speech but is too cowardly to say so this incident reminds me of stories ive read and seen of kind hearted people hiding jewish families in their homes from the nazis on the streets this dark time im staying optimistic that the goodness of people will prevail now that these democrat governors will not do anything to stop the riots in their cities the news cries for president trump to do something now all of a sudden because he is the only responsible only attempting to stop the burning and looting of cities he is a dictator my mother used to always say they carry their bibles because you ca not tell theyre christians by their behavior theres nothing christlike about what trump does if you wanted to fight trumps propaganda you might consider not disseminating every picture from every stunt like the biblechurch thingor do what he wants and share the picture he wants disseminated and frame the dialogue exactly how he wants ityour choice watching republicans praising trump threatening to send the military into us cities to attack protesting americans is maddening wrote a letter to send to senators and representatives urging them to take action and defend us before trump really gets the violence goingplease rt the letter please send it to your senrep this is the type of american i know from more than year of living in the usa ive never met anyone like donald trump and never want to do so after spending much of yesterday tweeting from the white house us president donald trump has emerged to deliver an ultimatum to the american people when catalan and french protesters were beaten by police guy made no such signal of his virtuebecause his condemnation or support is conditional on tribal allegiancesif you are in his tribe beat away but if you are in another tribe he soon finds his voice reminder in a year of hong kong protests china never killed protestors attacked journalists or deployed military in a week the us has done all of this president xi left the issue to hk government to resolve trump has overridden state officials who is authoritarian kremlin has iron clad control of the senatemarco rubio mitch mcconnell donald trump and lindsey graham campaigns took million from an oligarch linked to russia they are well compromised and no longer represent the interest of the united states an during gezi protests in june they the protesters have entered the mosque with shoes drunk alcohol inside it yesterday these thugs protesters have burned the bible dear trumploving hypocritesyou will not wear a mask because it infringes on some huge freedom but youre absolutely fine w trump sending the military into cities want to save lives wear the mask keep the military out never vote for trump again okay so i saw something just now that the military is planning to use real bullets against protestors tonight at the protest at the white house trump is legally allowed too i do not know if its a rumor but id rather not take that chance and just tell yall to be careful btw i have attended services in st john the evangelist episcopalian chuchni in lafayette square washington dc and not surprised they are appalled at trumps tear gassed brutality in clearing the protestors for his bible waving stunt we are honored to have the support of in our race to take back new york is excited to join president trump in the great american comeback america is just inches away from a martial lawtrump deploys the army but if the state governors refuse to allow the army in their states then trump has a constitutional right to impose a martial law across americaarmy will take over everyone talking about trump holding the bible upside down in horror movies you always know that the demonic presence is nearby when the crosses on the wall start to pivot upside down look i do not make the demonic rules i just point them out trump is and always has been a moral issue what contempt i have for every politician and journalist who has ever tried to ingratiate themselves to him or even strained to be evenhanded he did not need to say anything most religious leaders use a time like that to try to impress with flowery words the picture of holding the bible paints words donald trump now officially blaming white anarchists this is an antiblack divide and conquer narrative and if you got swept up in it in it at any point in the last week you need to take a break and think about why donald trump agrees with you trump gassed our clergy and hurt peaceful protesters so he could use the church as a political prop the word abomination exists for behavior like this flash bangs are scary rubber bullets are scary tear gas is scary military choppers are scary covid is scary unemployment is scary food insecurity is scary all the sirens im hearing are scary barr is scary putin is scary republicans are scary but most scary trump black people are not happy right now white people are not happy right now hell donald trump is not even happy right now but you know who is vladimir putin oh he is getting one hell of a return on his investment dave batista calls jaxson ryker of the forgotten sons a sorry ass motherfucker for supporting donald trump term antifa is being used by trump regime to divide black from white protesters in other words genuine from anarchists that these protests are largely multiracial is a massive threat to the state america in flames its economy already in ruins trump is the best investment putin has ever made breaking tucker carlson called out trump last nightthe president reassured america that he and his family were safe he did not mention protecting the rest of the nation much of which was then on fire he seemed aware only of himselftrump just lost tucker carlson people replying about insurrection act that act can only be passed through congress from what has been said trump does not plan on waiting on congress therefore making it illegal america under marshal lawprotestors on its streetsjournalists arrested dead million ill out of workthe economy tankedtrump wants a photo opwelcome to one by one we the people will arrest agbarr trump his crime family his crime administration wilbur ross who runs trumps laundromat prison is waiting democratic members of congress governors what are you going to do to stop trumps lawlessness martial law and theocracyplease tell me you have a plan beyond ripping up his speech and clapping sideways as we descend into dictatorship hey why did not you cover bidens events today i wanted to see them we need a leader since trump is not one fuck george will and the bowtie he rode in on you want to destroy the right and empower the left because you do not like trump fuck you you nambypamby hasbeen who never conserved a single thing in all his time in the political arena words words words so many useless words donald trump is literally ripping this country apart if you still choose to ignore it i have nothing to say to you you are blind to what his actions are causing my hood like many others got destroyed by looters and fascists using a crime executed in a democratic city as the excuse and this moron thinks trump is declaring war on america is he sick stupid or both welp thats too bad i liked i wonder what pithy social media posts can be used to spin this its actually wendys taco bell and pizza hut he runs btw vote with your wallet yall bitcoin price surges to as trump threatens military crackdownfollow us on twitter or telegram to keep up with the latest news in the crypto space donald trump declared war on american citizens to hell with november he is unfit to lead and must be removed from office now trump is hiding ca not do a coherent speech he looked terrible at nasa ppl at his stage of dementia do not realize how bad they look in public kush saying lay low means they see his impairment as a big liability resigning is a reality coming at them that they still ca not face can i get this straight the police teargassed a crowd protesting against police violence to clear a space so trump could stand like a constipated centaur in highheels and and say protesters were wrong to protest against police violence seems extremely nonpoliceviolency a few days ago twitter censored one of trumps tweets for glorifying violence and now we have countless examples of street violence being glorified on twitter will not be censored though because the standard was always subjective and never legitimately enforceable some police listened walked with protesters or even prayed with them they are americas heroesothers fed the hate that causes violence or committed violence themselves they are trumps heroes you choose it ca not be both should the photo of trump standing in front of a boarded up church holding a bible upside down be the photo that wikipedia uses cuz it says so much in one photo as trump declares actual war on us citizens johnson strips rights from and prepares to impose economic sanctions on uk citizens and both of them needlessly kill tens of thousands with rank incompetence i think we can conclude that chubby blond populists are fucking bad news disgusting donald trump had respectful and peaceful protesters violently removed for a photo op our leaders in washington have failed us we did not forget about mike brown snowden manning wikileaks drone war should we continueyou expanded the surveillance state just like trump the difference the mainstream media liked you hes gonna use the military against people who are for the most part protesting peacefully in order to end the violence caused by riot police and police brutality trump giving governors tips he picked up in epsteins mansion ps this tough guy spent the night hiding in the wh bunker with the lights off this is why trump is incapable of hearing s peaceful protest and in fact raged against ittrump is a rapistnever forget that i am your president of law and order trump says in the rose garden as protesters are teargassed by the police just blocks away maga mantrump stands strong at saint johns churchlike a boss trump walks to st johns church torched by protesters last night holds up bible and attacking your president is somehow a good thing to do umm yes if the police or

supporting capitalism fascistsantifa are anticapitalists masquerading are antifascists i was a republican before this and an anarchist now we do not have a president we have a coward and bastard we have the right to protest its our rights you are viloated our human rights trump enough is enough impeachment needs to happen a combination of a lot of thingsfury of deep rooted racism together with unemploymentfrustration casued by covid fueled by administrations trump failure to address the issue swiftly and responsibly plus democratic and other interests trump just mentioned protecting second amendment rights in an address about taking strong action against riotersthis is a loud fucking dog whistle the president tried to prove he was tough by ordering volleys of tear gas and rubber bullets to be fired on peacefully assembled americans in the process he reminded us the kind of person he is and it has nothing to do with toughness president trump has primed this protest moment to devolve into a violent act to fill the streets with the military creates the possibility of a spark that will explode with more violence and death vigilante groups with baseball bats roaming the streets of philadelphia violence sorry we have to play alternative headlines trump believes america needs a good cry sends tear gas canisters to help trump promises help for cities facing covid negroes promises

compassion it was simply nowhere to be found land of the freepresident of the usa threatening to use us army against its own people if states do not do as he wisheswonder how many of those who will

hold books and also has dementia the flying saucer hair is a bonus a black man is murdered by police after another black man was lynched by racists and trumps response is to target the left with police and militarywhybecause the left stands with blacks and trumps white nationalism ca not have that president trump is projected to add more than trillion to the national debt for the fiscal years through that could swell by another trillion if lawmakers pass another round of covid stimulus legislation as has been rumored trump was a psyop to turn a generation of dispossessed young men into neoconservative shills who watch fox news and get a case of the vapors over a memo or a press briefing that will never amount to anything the arc of the moral universe may be long but it bends towards justice mlk jr change is slow but there must be hope despair suits the tormentor everytime i think about trump i am not really thinking about trumpi am thinking about those who support trump i

outside agitatorsfocus must be kept on the coldblooded murder of george floyd and the systemic racism in law enforcement police reinforced by national guard troops forcefully pushed back protesters near the white house to clear a way for pres trump to visit a church just minutes after he said he wanted a military show of force against violent protests gripping the country i am loving watching the collapse of american exceptionalism if theres one thing trumps presidency has inadvertently done well its bring american hypocrisy to the fore i love it he declared a dictatorship thats what just happened hes declared hes turning the army on us krystalball the president is declaring war on american citizens trumps disaster is an unforced error he stepped into a strong economy and a nation with a strong position internationally plans were in place for dealing with pandemics and police reform trump took all of this and broke it for his own glory reports from the white house are saying trump was upset about the news reports of him hiding in a bunker and wanted to be seen walking out the white house front door and down the street what a little man anderson cooper blurts out oh my god after learning the real reason for donald trumps deranged military stunt via this is ultimately what the president is not processing until he really addresses police reform as the first part of any other statement the protests will not stop i have often said that trump would kill us all rather than be embarassed thats what his photo op and attacking the protesters and implementing the insurrection act is about his embarrasment over being mocked for going into the wh bunker theres no protection for anyone anymore you will die cops are tear gassing protesters without any regard to the effects on people with covid the first time i experienced tear gas was at a portland protest after trump was elected i was tear gassed by cops several times over days i got sick fluid in my lungs hard to breathe while trump was speaking today peaceful protestors were being teargassed and cleared out of the way so he could walk over to the church for his photo op holding a bible which he has never read and whats his solution to the all the pain people are feeling if this does not scare the fck out of you i do not know what will the trump i knew was a broken little coward for sure but a sadist dreaming of becoming a dictator he is the kind of thug who would smile at public executions bishop marian edgar budde of the dc episcopal diocese includes st johns where trump had his photoop is livid with trump she had no idea he was doing this and feels his message is antithetical to jesus teachingsshes a little bit of awesome something tells me that the suburban evangelicals attending ford f church

peaceful protestors tear gassed to take picture by church watch fox news for minutes trump did great job getting violent protestors out by the church in which he later visited and took pictures the news is such a joke these days the fascist speech donald trump just delivered verged on a declaration of war against american citizens i fear for our country tonight and will not stop defending america against trumps assault tucker carlson absolutely eviscerated jared kushner for his sneering attitude to trump voters for being behind trumps worst decisions the whole editorial was incredible hats off to arlington county virginia for withdrawing their police from dc they said trump put them in a compromising position when he wanted them to attack peaceful protesters just so he could have a photo op in front of a church the president of the united states has promised to deploy the military to attack the countrys own people for protesting racism fuck trump and anyone anyone who supports him fuck you all many state governors rejected trumps calls that troops be deployed to stop protests over the death of george floyd stay out of our business illinois gov jb pritzker said via now whyd everybody just ignore the fact that trump paid off families where he forcefully had sex with children aged girls boys that book in his hand has all of the answers to the problems we are seeing that book is what will save us all trump is the result of just how much parts of america hated a black man being president and the thought of a woman getting the jobthats some hate a us secret service counter assault team member carries a sniper rifle through lafayette park as us president donald trump holds a photo opportunity in front of st johns episcopal church across from the white house photo by what is he an msnbc pundit this douchebag and every single member of congress should be on the streets bearing witness to what people are being subjected to the hands of the law enforcement bearing witness to their own failure not tweeting from their ruling class hideout trump survived the terror of stds in the s that is why he is so able to lead us now my year old republican mother who voted for trump in asked me to help her change her registration to democrat yesterday there is hope after all not only is open carry not at all legal in ca but neither is that mag ca does not allow magazines over rounds also the pistol grip on the ar is illegal in ca this weapon is beyond illegal to own breaking this washington post article seems to imply that attorney general bill barr personally ordered the attack on lafayette park which is exactly how this should be framed as a violent attack on peacefully assembled us citizens they were gassed assaulted and shot time to boycott wendys paaneras pizza hut burger king popeyes and taco bell they have all donated tpo trump and are going to be on his economic advisory board attn resisters please share does manhattan need to have

peaceful protesters getting tear gas because of trump to protesters violating curfew because they started throwing rocks and rioting while filming live they changed their tune real quick you know trump leaked that call to show how weak the democrat governors are before he showed america how tough he is righttheir weakness will no longer be able to be hidden courageous houston police chief tells president trump to shut up if he does not have anything constructive to say over murder of george floyd says the majority of police officers will continue to stand and march with those protesting remember how some of us said trump is a racist and he would try to exploit the chaos to declare an emergency unleash the military potentially declare martial law and either postpone or suspend the elections to stay in power we were all crazy top gop senators are calling on president trump to take a far more compassionate approach amid the deep unrest following the death of george floyd in minnesota raising concerns about dividing a badly bruised nation further news in response to possible trump use of the insurrection act st paul mayor melvin carter says minnesota governor tim walz has guaranteed to him in minnesota were not doing it were not federalizing our troops trump walked over to that church tonight for his photoop with an entourage of about people not one black

trumps rose garden speech is about turning america into a military police state with pm curfews under the guise of law and order deploying the national guard and the us army to dominate our streets and neighborhoods is so chillingwelcome to the peoples republic of america someone who knows nothing of me who ive never heard of never met calls himself a reporter while pretending to be a mindreader and disseminating media matters type false smear propagandapreorder for more on this trend the potus had a crowd of peaceful protestors dispersed by tear gas rubber bullets so that he could appear at a church holding a bible as a prop to say hes checks notes rubs eyes rechecks notes an ally of all peaceful protesters were not ok with that right donald trump killed his personal assistant carolyn gombell in october he strangled her because hed gotten her pregnant and was threatening to tell the press then he bribed nypd police chief bernie kierik to cover it up its time to investigate perhaps for the first time americans are seeing only a glimpse of what victims of us foreign policy in the middle east latin america other regions of the world have been suffering for decadeswhats worse is its financed by us citizenskarma hitting home it seems these clowns are looking for any excuse possible to deploy us troops on us soil against us citizensclearly trump and the gop have forfeited their us citizenship in this audio trump is heard saying that disturbed young girls with family trauma are the best in bed please spread and let everyone know what kind of president we have american legislators have to find a way to remove trump for the good of the country wether that be by a medical decree or an emergency law the man is a megalomaniac if you go after the left and youre not a trump person people have no fucking idea how to even approach arguing with you so they just proceed as though you are a trump person and bring him up incessantly you see ive spent years studying how republicans contort themselves to excuse justify and enable the behaviors of donald trump its become predictable to the point of parody but this teargassing citizens to facilitate a photoop with a bible no idea how they spin this for the love of god i am on my knees begging you if you are or older please register to vote and get to the polls in november you are seeing in real time what is happening with trump as our president he needs to be voted out or things will only get worse vote blue tonight the president of the us threatened military intervention against the states the empire has turned in on itself who knew that would happen in people always used to get real cranky when we compared to but its true hitler was horrible too heres a question for all white people including me what would you do and why does president trump not condemn racism and hatred great that the education act was signed into law thank you to for your leadership this important legislation will ensure we teach future generations about the you can say trump is racist condemn the systemic killing of black people by the us police support the black lives matter movement aaaand also address systemic racism in aotearoa beyond ironic that trump let the governors deal with a killer of over but now when they do not need his ham fisted help he is gleeful about sending in federal troops beyond shameful he needs to be removed from office this incompetent fool is calling out trump while it sounds like the purge is happening outside my window in midtown manhattan and friends are sending me photos of all the looting they are watching at street level across the city as protesters gathered outside the white house on friday night the secret service rushed trump to the underground bunker beneath the executive mansion previously used during terror threats rachel maddow points out that trump has all but given up caring about the coronavirus and instead wants to play out a military fantasy by sending us troops into american cities heavily armed federal officers fired rubber bullets and teargassed peaceful protesters outside the white house to clear the path for president trump to visit st johns church sinclair lewis once said when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross trump told governors in a conference call today that rioters must be arrested and tried and they have to go to jail for long periods of time or until kim kardashian lets them out the bible has long been one of the most dangerous books in the world and never more so than when its wielded as a prop by racists weve been moving in this direction every day of trumps presidency but that does not make this moment any less terrifying it is absolutely terrifying trump and many republicans just praised armed protesters in michigan a few weeks ago they claimed to believe in freedom liberty now theyve completely flipped their standard are supporting a rank authoritarian crackdown bc theyre ideologically opposed to these protesters jesus wishes the american people the best of luck with the overthrowing of dictator trump this man is no fucking christian hell hes not even a man illinois shtty governor jb pritzker says trump ca not bring federal troops into illinois almost shot and dead in chicago this past weekend sit down and stfu you perennial loser hello everyone this girl yall probably follow her its a trump supporter unfollow her right now spread the word we do not know joes a pedophile but there are literally reports that trump has raped children gov cuomo goes on cnn trashes trump for calling out military to crush leftist mobs and looters as looters wipe out fifth avenue in ny city video the fact that trump spoke with zuckerberg on friday and putin today but still has not addressed the american people tells you pretty much everything you need to know about him just to be clear when putin orders trump to act and trump orders to act it means the are technically russian agents release the trump putin call or resign we will not be ruled from the kremlin taylor swift to donald trump after stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence we will vote you out in november im going to be brutally honest i do not know what to do right nowi have not lived through something like thisi do know im not going to quit despite people who are desperately trying to stop usim going to fight trumps agenda and for what is righti need you to help obamabacked fbi entrap general flynn russia investigation was a hoax impeachment inquiry against trump was unlawful democrats got insane now they are using antifa terrorists to take down trump important to notethis was a peaceful protest there was no rioting there was no violence until police fired tear gas and rubber bullets on american citizens to disperse them before president trump made a speech today the president did not just put dem governors mayors and antifa on noticehe also intends to investigate members of congress and political organizations that have supported and or funded the antifathis president means businesses is it ok to love your presidentcan you imagine the angelic realm protecting him if only we had eyes to see pray for trump breaking president trump just endorsed the idea of using air assault operations on us citizens how can anyone be ok with this could work we have to remember though clinton had problems bush is remembered for invading iraq then we have trumps base birthers fox all against obama maybe the wives could do it including this latest one so neither jacinda ardern nor todd muller would say donald trump was racist but the pm declined to say it in a way that was smoother and deployed less staring i fuking hate trump but this obama nostalgia is getting on my nerves the national guard was also deployed during the occupy protests in that protesters at standing rock were met with contracted mercs attack dogs fire hoses in this is the guy who as an experiment tweets exactly what trump tweets to see what do about it he was suspended us black people have had to resist the state longer than four years their entire lives and not out of choice the protests are not a political rally or an issue that can be resolved with an election or removing trump we need a complete overhaul of the system trump called for mayors governors to dominate the streetsordered federal police to fire tear gas rubber bullets at peaceful protestorsthen held up bible to declare himself our law order presidenthe is dangerous inflammatory when america needs leadership healing terrific point from on cnn the protesters we all just saw are not looters theyre young people who are full of idealism and want to make a statement thats wholly legitimate we all saw that on national tv and trumps magical lying powers ca not make that disappear trump has just made completely explicit that he wants armed forces police and military to dominate the american people that is the essential nature of fascism police aggressively cleared protesters outside the white house before trump walked to st johns church for a photo opportunity bible in hand most ppl can gaze upward w their eyes while moving their head back to see upward trump ca not do either w his ftd its almost like the need to look up initiated an involuntary jerk backwards he then seemed disoriented like he jumped off a swing he should be wearing a helmet i like my white supremacists honest like this trump makes it clear preserving the status quo is it this is about forcing them to live under oppressionhe might as well have just come out and said if you ca not dominate these darkies you ai not white peaceful protestors by the white house were tear gassed and shot with rubber bullets so the president could not have a photo op at a church fuck donald trump and if u support his trash ass unfollow me my heart is broken watching the news here was the us view of the unprovoked sucker punch to the face from the cop what insanity all so trump can clear the square for a photo op in front of a church while teargasing its priests my sons pharmacy in sacramento was attacked last night the windows were shattered youre not doing a damn thing but mocking trump bring in the militaryyoure a failure as governor like you were as mayor of sf i think i get blindsided by twitter because im always like yes people are sharing my views and the community is huge but really its not when racism still exists and people like trump are in power we need to get the message out further thats why we need these protests president trump holds a bible outside of a burned st johns church this is one of those powerful photos that will last throughout history you are deploying the united states military against your own people and that is the act of a dictator civil war is now inevitable and you will not win trump ran a series of attack ads against native american casinos alleging with no proof that they were guilty of crimes trump fired a black contestant from the apprentice for being overeducated sycophantic lapdog watercarrier mediathats how was elected chairman of the idu is this what you want your democracy in canada to become think about what youre doing think about the shame your children will feel knowing what youve done future generations will remember trump and his supporters as todays nazis its time to decide if youre going to be on the right side of history you said nothing literally nothing in condemnation of daily and brutal police attacks on in france about which you could have done something given your exalted position you utter rampant hypocrite bishop at dc church outraged by trump visit i just ca not believe what my eyes have seen you talk about going back to normal obamas normalyour batshit crazytrump has been the best president in historyyou and all of your dirty cohorts being paid off by soros to do his bidding can go to hellyou have been part of the problem for too long bishop budde comments on president trumps visit to st johns episcopal church he was proceeded by a violent clearing of nonviolent protesters to make his way and he was using our church as a backdrop and the bible as a prop god bless all who have been helping during this time pass your stories forward so we can continue the chain of information of violence agitated by trump as trump stokes the flames of racial hatred and orders violence against his own people and nick ferrari ask the most pressing question on this nd june did barack obama let down black americans trump threatens to use the insurrection act declare martial and deploy the army against protesters what us imperialism has done globally is being deployed against its own people stop going to movies let these scum feel the pain most of these small bussinesses are now facing they support these criminals and pay their bail trump could have waited until pm when the protestors would have been in technical violation of the curfew and scheduled the gassing for thenofficers could have refused a blatantly illegal order to had a lawful assembly at for no reason these little tests have meaning i firmly believe covid did not work as planned for the dems so this race war was the next in their box of goodies to oust trump they will burn down the country in order to take it back not once in his perverted despot speech did trump address police brutality racism or murder that is all you need to know he does not care there was absolutely zero effort to communicate and negotiate with that child just sheer brutality woven into their psyche fuck them new laws must be passed when trump is out and they must be first on the list the fact that just weeks ago white people were on the streets protesting with weapons in hand just to break the stay at home order over a haircut and he did not go to great lengths to stop them now hes calling on the military to stop a peaceful protestyou see the problem more president trump just berated governors and mayors for how they are handling the protests calling them fools per person on the call trump outside of st johns churchreporter is that your bibletrump its a bible ive really never seen anyone look more uncomfortable holding a bible they did not hide this either trump declared his intentions before he was president bannon never pretended he wanted snugging other than destruction hundreds of newspaper editorial boards called for clinton and nixon the resign but newspapers are not calling for trumps resignation my latest piece investigates why it reveals a lot about our politics today soin less than like minutes of just scrolling my feed i witnessed a black dude on his knees pleading with officers singled out and roughly arrested a radio order from trump to kill on sight the officer broadcasting it says for every nigger for mexicans president trump uses teargas and rubber bullets against peaceful protesters not rioters to make a public statement outside a church holding a biblewhen the head of state does this things are really bad every single day since protests began the authorities have escalated giving people more of a reason to protest and now trump just escalated even bigger they want clashes they want the drama and the violence and the polarization its like they want a race war johnson not in power for a year yet has created divisionhatredmistrust loathing we are running headlong into the state americas in he is another trump power mad with zero humilitycarerespecttrust we need to get him out before it escalatesand it will trump is unable to take responsibility for what hes done and have not done enough and he will never apologizedo not expect him to back down expect him to escalate little lord fartandannoy has overstepped bigtime this is not an insurrection its simply a protest his photo op was juvenile got people hurt to feel important grossly disgusting i alone can fix it donald j trump july th accepting the s nomination for president of the united states members reject trumps bid to bring russia in from the cold citing russias aggressive destabilizing activity that threatens collective security of our allies russias continued disrespect flaunting of international rules i did not know they had the bible in the s i thought trump was only one who had one crazy the similarities between the two leaders president trump walking to st johns church which was set on fire with bible in hand was a direct message for atheist george sorosyoure not going to beat god me or the united states of america earlier today trump pulled his best alassad and tear gassed his own citizens just so he could have a photo op disgusting reagan was mentally failing but he was not a cowardbill clinton was unfaithful but he is not a cowardg w bush is an idiot but he is not a cowardtrump is a mentally failing unfaithful idiotand a coward who hides in his bunker and tear gasses protesters for a photo op theres a pandemic that has killed americans and jobs in america due largely to federal government incompetence and its only the second worst thing about trumps presidency and in the united states antifa have never killed anyone unlike their enemies in klan hoods and squad cars i do not understand how so many people can still support trump especially those who claim to be christians there have been so many instances brought to light of him being sexist racist etc yet you turn a blind eye just because i do not get it maybe it was actually bad when obama helped preserve and expand bushs panopticon that could be handed over to someone like donald trump they cleared out this peaceful protest so trump could get his camera time and march himself into the church next door this was all for optics and all it shows is that trump is willing to ignore americans rights and human rights just so he can look good a real newspaper would have a headline and lede like as peaceful protestors are gassed trump plans military rulethe president spoke to vladimir putin earlier today and this authoritarian move is straight out of his playbook sisolak condemns trumps suggestion of unilaterally sending troops to states to quell unrestvia please please read up on the cult of the shining city by holding up a bible in front of a church trump is messaging evangelicals that were now in a holy war you ca not afford not to know this right now check out trump is going to issue orders for the army to start mowing down protesters and biden is going to say they should throw them in guantanamo instead you are so weak and pathetic stay inside so you do not fall and break your hip we all saw you almost fall during spacex launch spurs gregg popovich unleashes on president trump following death of george floyd an fn basketball coach loser stfu cnn orange man bad trump is weak and hiding in his basement not handling this trump makes respectable public statements and military plans to end anarchy and senseless violencealso cnn omg trump is hitler and a dictator and wants violence bishop budde comments on president trumps visit he was proceeded by a violent clearing of nonviolent protesters to make his way and he was using our church as a backdrop and the bible as a prop in ways that i found to be deeply offensive gosh he even makes his daughter uncomfortable boris johnson should front up in parliament today and condemn president trump in the strongest possible way but he will not because hes a spineless huckster who is responsible for many racist tropes in the past populism sticks together president trump has gained another followers in less than days yes i have follower envykeep it up folks i love this president amazing how nigerians see trump in the comments comparing a raging bull like trump to tired if you like lifeless buharitrumps only weakness is that he talks too much and is petty anyways if you do not speak out against the actions of then you are supporting the actions of donald trump are clearly not on the side of americans please please please watch the jeffrey epstein filthy rich documentary on netflix donald trump bill clinton and prince andrew are all rapists they were all close with epstein and raped girls as young as in trump paid for print ads calling for the execution of five black teenagers the central park who had been wrongly accused of a series of violent crimes in central park even after dna evidence proved their innocence trump said last year they were still guilty is what the democrats want they want to scare people and destroy this countrywe cannot let america fall so the governors and mayors should step up and stop people from burning down our country if not then trump will save us and the country trumps move towards overt facism continues for all to see but his threat of using the military is in direct contravention of the posse comitatus act of he does not seem to care any more to hide his increasingly dictator like tendencies this incompetent fool is calling out trump while it sounds like the purge is happening outside my window in midtown manhattan and friends are sending me photos of all the looting they are watching at street level across the city i look forward to every fact checker in the media giving big pinocchios for this whopper of a lie that he called for a nationwide lockdown in january conclusion trump any president can stay in power for as long as he or she wants do whatever he or she wants with a stroke of a pen yes a dictatorship in the united states completely legal in the eyes of the us constitution and world and nobody can save you but yourselves boomoann reporter chanel rion to kayleigh mcenany will trump administration investigate members of congress for support or ties to antifa video via ftfyim whiteim britishim straightim a racistim a racisti support the militaryim a racistim a racistim a racistim uneducatedi love animalsim a christianim a racist you guys i am really mad about trump using the insurrection act to disperse peaceful protesters and about a million other things but i literally lold at thisreporter is that your bibletrump its a bible appalling today rather than standing with peaceful protestors who are demanding change declared war against his own people he has made america grieve again and does not deserve to hold the title of president of the united states i think right now more than ever is important to speak up speak up for the black lives speak up for the sexually assaulted this is a big fuck you to donald trump not only are you a smug idiot but you are also a racist and rapist hell has a special place for you pictured trump and jeffrey epstein both now confirmed child rapists please do not let this go ignored senator mcconnell confirming more judges as the nation is literally bleeding with the votes of the same senators who refused to convict trump at his impeachment trial illinois gov jb pritzker labeled president donald trump a miserable failure as nationwide protests have intensified over the death of george floyd so apparently trump arranged for peaceful protesters outside the white house to be tear gassed this was so he could walk unhindered to a church after his televised speech in which he threatened to quell protests with us military force those are both things that fascists do unfortunately democrats were hoping for something like this to happen they do not grieve for floyd they are happy that the man died so they can blame it on trump and destroy the country i just saw a tweet from bho they do not care if president trump wins theyre going after the house senate that will lock this country into socialism with their new laws we cant let them win at the local state level everyone vot red chanel rion continues to be the only honest reporter in the reporter to will administration investigate members of congress for support or ties to antifa every fucking thing trump et al have done since before he was inaugurated is illegal but when you have an entire party of republicans in congress who are cowards and traitors it doesnt matter vote every republican out of office i was outraged that he felt that he had the license to do that and that he would abuse our sacred symbols and our sacred space in that way rev mariann edgar budde said of president trump holding up a bible outside st johns church jesuit priest on trump photoop using the bible as a prop while talking about sending in the military bragging about how your country is the greatest in the world and publicly mocking people on a daily basis is pretty much the opposite of all jesus stood for im not among those who love bashing the which i consider our frontline defense against tyranny but this headline is stunningly bad totally missing what may be the most chilling day in the trump presidency yep trump just had a phone call with putin today did not putin hail himself as a law order leader during chaos he created himself black panthers this is exactly what is scared of when the blacks unites we are in destructible we are strong also trump spoke about invoking the insurrection act of which was used in the past but the point is he wants to invoke it again it is not currently passed during this timetypo but he talked about it this should alarm u take precaution the mexican flags in our faces throwing rocks at the horses damaged police cars starting fires it was a riot look it up it made national news from that point on i became a trump supporter i never posted about it or anything because i was afraid of the back flash x disenfranchising bame mp on today of all days all mps need to stand together against this vital that basic human values fundamental democratic principles trump party politics there is only one man standing between us and total anarchy in america president trump hope everybody understands that at least now given trumps bible photoop today worth reupping this hilarious viral clip from where he gave away the fact that hes never read a single line from it this is the visual that will define the entire failed trumpian experiment when his country needed a leader donald trump turned off the lights and hid under the bed via team trump online with and text trump to a new poll done has tied with in south carolina at oh boy what fun it would be to knock off one of the most pathetic trump sycophantslets get it done on the day that donald trump literally threatens to use the us army to shoot people of colour demonstrating against racist extra judicial killings by police why would s big question of the day be did obama live up to his promises president donald trump we are with you first australians downunder maga nixon walked among the protesting crowd at the lincoln memorial trump had people tear gassed so he could get a photo op both are crooks nixon had courage that whole line where people try to equate the moral failings of trump biden by saying at least trump never started any wars is going to age real bad if the military opens fire on us citizens certain segments of leftist twitter may want to adjust their post histories now trump is deploying the military on his own people trump says he will deploy the us military if state officials fail to quell protests if you are white and placing blame squarely on trump for this rash of police violence i want you to consider the democratic governors who have funded and deployed these statesanctioned militias your presidential candidate whose first suggestion was that these militias merely one of the reasons i am being hardassed about asking the protesters to observe the curfew and deprive trump of oxygen is because i know that trumps entire play in november is to shoot for an electoral college win and a popular vote loss its his only play i do not choose i choose america and trump which is why i will vote to reelect him in november he has consistently put america first i know i should not add oxygen but i am just so fcking angry about this tweet utterly disgusting weasel of a man licking the ase of trump having fcked up this country with racism he is endorsing it in america too when matt gaetz is not getting arrested for drunk driving or attempting to intimidate a federal witness hes advocating for the extrajudicial killing of american citizensyou can donate to his opponent here just weeks ago trump praised armed protesters in michigan but today he orders the us military to shoot peaceful protesters across from the rose garden with rubber bullets and tear gas the difference hes using our military to harm his political opponents trump stop the chinese coup detat that president bolsonaro is suffering the chinese communist party bribed brazilian politicians to overthrow bolsonaro the chinese agent who is organizing all of this is yang wanming tucker carlson rips into president trumps senior adviser jared kushnerthe presidents famously sharp instincts the ones that won him the presidency almost four years have been since subverted at every level by jared kushner if you like what i said above im running against pennsylvanias version of please help us unseat this yr extremist who idolized trump by donating a few dollars to its worth noting that st johns the church trump is standing in front of as well the episcopal church at large have been staunchly opposed to almost all of trumps policies trump has told us time again who he truly is wed best believe him and vote him out this november eyes do not lie a democracy if we can keep it trump has just declared martial lawhes deploying the national guard and failing that the us army to dominate the streets remember when trump called some rd world countries shitholes what has he done to america in less than years theres no help for us if this crazed man gets reelectedvote november rd no matter whatthis is the most important election i think trump just stepped in it bad if he thinks this is going to scare people away he does not understand how protests work he just invited the people to test his weakness do not start telling me if you voted for donald trump and boris johnsonboth have racist histories and you accepted that when you voted them in trump clearing his way with

opp at a church whether or not you believe putin helped trump orchestrate the execution of george floyd trump called putin today and now hes considering invoking the insurrection act which ispretty similar to what hitler and putin did after their false flags trump is threatening to send the us military to cities to stop the riots but he is very limited in what he can actually do with the military on us soil via plus trump can call for a federal jobs program to rebuild the infrastructure destroyed by antifa people gets jobs paychecks economy recovers winning on bishop mariann edgar budde of the episcopal dioscese of washington says president trump used st johns for a photo op without her mission i am outraged the world is watching while foreign reporters are getting hit with rubber bullets and tear out of the blue during a peaceful demonstration in front of the white house because trump wanted a photo op again this is not great america trump promised that the world would no longer laugh at us when he was president he kept that promise they are definitely not laughing trump had peaceful protesting americans gassed to get out of his way so he could do a photoopwhat chapter of hitlers playbook is trump on father martin echoing episcopal bishop marian buddys outrage at the trump photo op at st johns part of her diocese if there is one person who does not want law and orderthat person is donald j trump trump just gassed his own people hes ordering military hurt members of the press this is now on you we will not forget i am wondering if impeached trump were impeached again would the senate remove him this time pentagon officials express concern as trump threatens to use military to dominate protestors cnnpolitics shame on and the rest of the for staying silent as trump teargassed peaceful protesters for a photo opportunity you have sold out the united states of america obama won the nobel peace prize trump generates hate for america around the world he needs to be removed from office quickly the damage will become more long lasting every day he is in office this will be the first time the democrats have tried this under trumphe knew they would it was inevitable if you think he barr were not ready for this you have not been paying attention lately i keep hearing the words but i ca not seem to find the actions more news like this has to go viral we need these questions to finally get a yes or no answer i doubt he could tell you one verse from a bible perhaps hes heard of the commandments he routinely breaks every single one of them aside from the th something tells me fred would be proud his kkk legacy loved on great new piece from on the plans of the us to restart nuclear testing opinion trump is preparing to restart nuclear tests for the first time in years we should all be worried organize like your life depends upon it do not leave anything to chance the revenge for the shredding of the constitution for the cowardice careerism which paved the way for will come in november when the army of the decent sweeps out trump the gop senate tucker carlson going off on jared kushner no one has more contempt for donald trumps voters than jared kushner does yall these trump supporters r real quit now meanwhile in the united states of americahad this happened in iran russia or china there would have been calls for sanctions someone on facebook looked at the photo of trump snr below and wrote he resembles stalin of germany stalin of germany the miseducation of our citizens is complete no im afraid its just we ca not just skip forward now we could of had the politicized cult of the gop senate not voted party line to acquit on turn the usa into trumps fascist autocratic dictatorial empire abandoning the constitution democratic republic trump literally called black contestants the nword on the apprentice mark burnett has hours of this type of footage who ruled the and was not ba dictator now msm is realising itdo not build any hope on who could succeed trump at the white house warmongering is consistent at least trump is a clown and keeps us entertained like in a constant circus now that trumps done a photo op with a bible as a publicity stunt while he blinds civilians with mms it is a good time to remember that jesus christ himself would have metaphorically backhanded our cheeto in chief the republican party is run by donald trump who is a racist everyone has a perfect right to do whatever they want with that information but it is factual trump just stands in front of the church and holds up a bible while posing for photos he does not even go inside for a faux tour of the damage or make a pretense of having any purpose in going there other than to pose for photos dr anthony fauci one of the most prominent members of the white house coronavirus task force said he has not spoken to or met with president trump in two weeks after finding out trump was hiding in his bunker i think its best if we do not have a coward addressing the nation biden who visited a protest site should do it i was a witness to the peaceful protests at the white house here is my video from shortly after when the police started firing teargas and setting off flash bangs to move the crowdfor trumps photoop trump is a narcissistic psychopath and america needs to wake up to the fact hes advocating the use of extreme violence under the guise of religion and god its deeply shameful and offensive has the church spoken out over it trump just declared the use of the insurrection act of allowing for military intervention in times of civil unrest without congressional approval this is literally another way of killing people during protests legally this is what the australians woke up toone of their reporters getting punched live so that trump can take a photo op sound the alarm on what trump is trying to do but do not ascribe magical powers to trump and do not pretend hes winninghes not winning hes losing and hes terrified he literally just emerged from a bunker do not obey in advance fight this little hes weak during the last week or two gained about million more followers not bad for someone who is so hated in this country i think every time ppl like biden pelosi or hillary open their mouthsa new trump follower is born trump has lost control and the respect of the country he has left americans to suffer starve and die and left our cities to burn up in hate he needs to resign and the republicans behind his authoritarian rise best brace themselves for trials when this is over democrats are encouraging violent destruction of their own cities in order to force trump to respond and blame the escalated conflict on the president the fact that trump would rather thousands of innocent lives injured and killed than to arrest three officers and support the lives of his black citizens truly speaks volumes vote him out november rd all they wanted was for four police officers to be charged but he decided to take this route causing more disarray destruction and death its beyond me how stubborn and racist the trump administration can be four cops over every black american alllivesmatter is bullshit president trumps historical walk from the whitehouse to st johns church it was vandalized last night we have an amazing president weve all had enough it will get worse as power intoxicates trump and those around him it will probably end in calamitysubstantial domestic protest and violence january curious to hear from republican critics who told me i was being over the top the governors should have asked this asshole if he is talking to them from the safety of their bunker he wants to bring tiannamen square to our country you can do much to further that via this platform do not allow trump to use it to inflame the violence treat him like anyone else who promotes it and to this day no one wants to discuss trump being owned by the kremlin since soviet union days and the billions he laundered its truly outrageous how the biggest red flag of what made trump a russian agent has been completely ignored can someone explain how law order workspeaceful protestors get tear gassed run off the streets in the light of daywhile criminals destroy loot stores deface property wreak havoc through city streets get bolder every night protests erupted for a

about the killing of a black man in minnesota at the hands of police his schedule on monday had no public events a rarity for the mediahungry president gop senator little marco rubio lies and says far left and far right activists are behind violent riotswtf not really little marco drats and rinos including trumphaters like you bill kristol are the ones behind the terrorists likely true reyf but it is an interesting phenomenon yes it is one thing for per cent of americans to still support trump that is staggering enough but for the life of me i do not get australians looking enviously at the usa and saying yup we need a bit more of that our communities are not battlespacesthis is not warthis is not the climate for military rhetoricwe must listen to the pain of our fellow americans support their right to speak out and protest and act to deliver the social justice and progress they demand and deserve donald trump is an unlawful president a confederate a dictator a fascist an authoritarian and a white supremacist he is waging war against his own citizenswhat would you call the party he leadswhat would you call anyone who would belong to such a party evidently the police

combination of george wallace richard nixon he is not capable of leading our country as trump hides behind his iphone keyboard joe biden is out greeting potential voters having pictures taken with a maskall the young men kept saying was save us save us america has had enough the limpness and inertia of the opposition to trump has contributed to his ability to attack america and our laws with impunity he has seen it and taken advantage of it this is especially true of the democrats in congress there is outrage but inaction many state governors rejected trumps calls that troops be deployed to stop protests over the death of george floyd stay out of our business illinois gov jb pritzker said via if donald trump and those in power are afraid enough to threaten protestors with martial law

with you anticaa lobby to organise nationwide protests demanding scrapping of uapa bitcoin is on the rise because according to my analysis the bidens team has bought bitcoins for to covertly finance antitrump people and donald trump is aware of the role the bitcoin has started playing at the us political scene is is a joke did trump really trapped his people we fought to have the human rights and the right to protest and this man is taking our rights away this crazy disgusting dictator im an atheist myself but for those who believe this has to be a blasphemy trump is the antichrist its not just the president that needs to be changed the entire system that led to someone like trump being voted into power needs to be thrown out thats the only longterm solution this did not begin with

be done to all of us fuck donald trumpfuck authoritarianismfuck white supremacy especially fuck the police that enable all of the above we gotta save this country more than enough proof that cops lie to get away with murder and this is how trump wants to end riots by having law enforcement kill people sounds like a whole lot of dictatorship to me im not clear what trumps critics want to happen what alternative is there to using the police army to stop looting riots or to sending in police to break up covidspreading mass protests whats the other policy federal law enforcement cleared protesters out of the area with tear gas before trumps visit to st johns church tear gas canisters could be heard exploding as trump spoke in the rose garden he then walked over to the church hello

defends the police violently assaulting peaceful protesters journalists outside the white house for trumps photo op of course the president in any given city would have to have a secure corridor trump

demand was black lives redistribution these businesses would be more vicious than trump trumps plan to invite russia to the g blocked by germany the uk canada his infatuation with bringing putin in from the cold is weakening and dividing the democratic world when what is needed is more resolute american leadership via if this was a middle eastern country by now the us would be giving the president an ultimatum to step down and hand power to the democratic opposition of blm and antifa or face an aerial bombardment from nato trump rather have war and blood on the streets rather then just trying to make things better when he coulda jsut came out and said u know what black lives matter im gonna try to help and stop the killings but nah he want people to die donald trump is bringing

coward hiding in his basement rt if you agree that this is what leadership looks like just a reminder that still has snakes leakers and liars working in senior positions in his white houseits kinda obvious who some of them are too this quote is real some governors are showing some spine and resisting and challenging trump protestors are showing courage it is time for every leader to recognize that the game has changed the stakes could not be higher and that new tactics are required when the old ones do not work the literal only bright side at this moment is that donald trump ca not possibly be reelected now like if he is its over i have no faith in america after that and im a person who has a little too much faith in humanity please share if youre a us military member youre worried that trump may order you to take action against your fellow americans you have rights can say nocall the hotline at they can walk you through your options mr trump you do not know about your goth yetthe american dream is over trump posing with a bible after ordering tear gas and rubber bullets to be used against peaceful protesters is called fascism weve now entered the final phase of the trump erathe president is stuck in a vicious downward spiralhe is incapable of undertaking the policies necessary to address any crises so he grasps for actions that shock the senses trump refused to invoke the defense production act to save lives during a pandemic but happily invokes the insurrection act in an attempt to save his presidential campaign during a protest nothing like this has ever happened at facebook employees always voiced dissent internally todays walkout is a sign that anger is spilling over and that employees do not feel heard by zuckerbergsandberg republican officials strategists warned that if a wide partisan gap over mail voting continues in nov republicans could be at a disadvantage an unintended repercussion of presidents fearmongering about mail ballots that could hurt his partys chances i do not know about exploiting the bible but i see you exploiting your position to make christs church about political identities rather than our unity in christ that should be more concerning to the sheep in your fold than holding a bible matthew the only real reporter in room oann reporter chanel rion to kayleigh mcenany will trump administration investigate members of congress for support or ties to antifa video via governors whove failed to protect their citizens whine about trumps tweets how much you want to bet most of the rioters do not read them guts surrounded by secret service dc police and the us militaryafter they teargassed shot at and removed peaceful protestors so the cowardinchief can walk down an empty street and park yeah hes a real fucking rambo authoritarians polarize citizens into patriots v enemies discredit oversight institutions like inspectors general the media target courts to bolster bad behavior final act dissolve the bonds of democracy militarize police and crush the vote trump is near his end game such a disgracei have no mercy for people who just want to create chaos at a time like thisst johns church rector on aftermath of fire impromptu trump visit like im in some alternative universe mcconnell was asked minutes ago if he approved of how trumps handling the protests he ignored the question walked into his officewe win georgia we win the senate and we elect a civil rights champion please donate to rev warnock the race is tied and now its pretty clear why gen mark milley was walking about dc streets yesterday it sure as hell was not to check up on national guard troops trump is deploying active duty infantry troops against americans this is a tragic disgusting day for our country press releaseban antifa terrorsenator malcolm roberts calls on the prime minister to demonstrate the same political leadership as president trump and declare antifa a terrorist organisationlink wild that in a state with no open carry this guy pointed a gun into a crowd while shouting aggressively and none of the cops observing freaked out and shot at him in self defense before he could be safely arrested wonder how this man was so lucky i guess we will never know to recap trump refused to invoke the defense production act to save k american livesbut hes happy to invoke the insurrection act to deploy us military to take american livesstill no tests still no justice for george floyd still no peace we needed to clear the square of peaceful demonstrators with nonlethal ordnance ahead of curfew and amid rising tensions so the president could have a photo op ummantifa is literally burning our churches and desecrating our monuments the governors are not stopping it president trump is sending a visual message that he is protecting our first amendment is govcuomo inviting more violence to his stategov cuomo goes on cnn trashes trump for calling out military to crush leftist mobs and looters as looters wipe out fifth avenue in ny city video president trump was angered by coverage that he was rushed to the underground bunker during protests friday night and told aides he wanted to be seen outside the white house gates per leading in part to his walk to st johns today keir starmer condemned jeremy corbyn for telling the truth about the ehrc and has stayed silent on donald trump declare war on his own citizens thats how right wing he really is if you read the legal documents that were released detailing how donald trump jeffery epstein violently rped a year old girl then threatened her life if she told anyone your first reaction is to question her credibility i hope you get hit by a fucking bus all offense big great newsqdrop your were warnedqtrump signs social media executive order that calls for removal of liability protections over censoring this comes after us federal police assaulted an australian news crew while clearing lafayette park for trumps churchfront photo op yesterday the incident was carried live on one of their morning shows i ca not add anything much to what millions of other people are saying but hate racism with every bone in my body it is so stupid trump is vilea low rent nasty scumbag the trump administration has finalized a rule that allows dark money nonprofits to cease reporting information to the irs that the government would need to enforce campaign finance laws this is really bad america is literally coming apart at the seems at the hands and direction of trumpthis after yearshow bad will it become if he gets another years trump walked over to the church to hold up a bible backwardswas this so he can say he went to church this yearhes such a christianbut more of a white supremist guts surrounded by secret service dc police and the us militaryafter they teargassed shot at and removed peaceful protestors so the cowardinchief can walk down an empty street and park yeah hes a real fucking rambo peaceful protesters were gassed outside the white house so president trump could get a photo op at a historic church notice how much mocking and anger is directed at trump holding a bible they can claim whatever reasons they want but its because the hate god trump regime forces deploying police and military helicopters across the region to carry out low flying operations over protests these tactics are extremely risky for both pilots and civilians on the ground equivocation fallacy do not they teach you how to avoid that at harvard or is it all uninformed activism classes now trump did the photo w the with the bible because he is desperately appealing to his christian nationalist base thats how it helps him yall should not be perplexed please report on christian nationalism youre missing it he needs their vote thats why not just a photoop this will be a campaign commercial trump exploited police and the us militaryafter peaceful protesters were gassedto gather footage that will likely be used in political ads black lives matter for chicagoblack lives matter for new zealandblack lives matter for united kingdomblack lives matter for pakistanblack lives matter for the world sadly black lives does not matter for trump i am seeking justice peace thus president trump declared me a friend ally tonightnever before has a us president called me his friend its true andersons gonna need a psi pressure washer to get all the sand out of his vagina when trump wins again sad trump just said that every governor must deploy the national guard to stop the protests and if they do not he will deploy the military this is illegal the state governments have to request this its called states rights trump is not a king why will not trump condemn the flag of treason its time the media asked him is not it i find it horrifying that after years of racist hateful bile after trump openly called for protestors to be shot in the streets by the military his tweets have not been helpful is all republicans can muster you feckless cowards by the time i got back to my car around i was getting texts from people saying that trump was outside of st johns lafayette square i posted the psychopath in chief on medium last week it has views but it was turned down by multiple mainstream publications we must talk about trumps psychopathic need for dominance he is far more dangerous than i previously recognized trump tried to make a campaign video last night walking to a church trying to look serious holding up a bible instead he looked like a laughing stock poorly playing a part for which hes not suitedon the way he had the military violate peaceful protesters st a rights im listening to trump talk about establishing order as forces in front of me fire tear gas and rubber bullets on protesters it is utterly surreal after maga night i have never felt safer to be an american americans killed by a virus trump ignored americans out of work to lose their health insurance rioting in the streets heck of a job trump here is the bishops response to trump seizing the image of one of her churches after violently clearing protestors in an attempt to use it for a photo op hoping to pervert its message of love for a hateful purpose he had no permission and did it without even notifying her this is the crew trump put together to cross the street today for a photo op to prove hes not hiding in his bunker besides no masks notice anything peculiar hint not one person of color cnns jim acosta shouts at trump is this still a democracytrump no it never was we are a constitutional republicyou should take a civics lesson jimmy'"
