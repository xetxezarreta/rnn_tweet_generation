"Trump (who is not a Christian) is holding a Bible (which he's never read) the wrong way round (so we can't really see/know which book it is) because he doesn't know how to hold books, and also has dementia. The flying saucer hair is a bonus. https://t.co/6opRNS43uv"
A black man is murdered by police after another black man was lynched by racists and Trump's response is to target the Left with police and military.Why?Because the Left stands with blacks and Trump's white nationalism can't have that.
"President Trump is projected to add more than $7 trillion to the national debt for the fiscal years 2018 through 2021. That could swell by another $1 trillion if lawmakers pass another round of COVID-19 stimulus legislation, as has been rumored."
Trump was a psyop to turn a generation of dispossessed young men into neoconservative shills who watch FOX News and get a case of the vapors over a memo or a press briefing that will never amount to anything.

@jack You can do much to further that via this platform.  Don't allow Trump to use it to inflame the violence.  Treat him like anyone else who promotes it.
And to this day no one wants to discuss Trump being owned by the Kremlin since Soviet Union days and the billions he laundered. Its truly outrageous how the biggest red flag of what made trump a russian agent has been completely ignored

Not just a photo-op. This will be a campaign commercial. Trump exploited police and the US military—after peaceful protesters were gassed—to gather footage that will likely be used in political ads.
