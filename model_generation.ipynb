and continue to push thats what i said when i said in an interview that putin is not going into ukraine you can mark it down i am saying if i am president already in crimea this story is not about mr khan who is all over the place doing interviews but rather radical islamic terrorism and the us get smart mr khan who does not know me viciously attacked me from the stage of the dnc and is now all over tv doing the same nice wow it is unbelievable how distorted onesided and biased the media is against us the failing is a joke is laughable the dishonest media is fawning over the democratic convention i wonder why then my speech had millions of more viewers than crooked h i was viciously attacked by mr khan at the democratic convention am i not allowed to respond hillary voted for the

with me that alliance members must pay their bills this is a general i will like the rust belt was created by politicians like the clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like mexico end crookeds stop in johnstown pennsylvania where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians drew less than with bill vp obamas third term which would be terrible news for our economic growth seen below word is that crooked hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in pennsylvania perhaps it is because her husband signed nafta i turned down a meeting with charles and david koch much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics they will do much better why doesnt the media want to report that on the two big thursdays when crooked hillary and i made our speeches republicans won ratings crooked hillary clinton is soft on crime supports open borders and wants massive tax hikes a formula for disaster violent crime is rising across the united states yet

who never had the guts to run for president knows nothing about me his last term as mayor was a disaster general john allen who i never met but spoke against me last night failed badly in his fight against isis his record bad crooked hillary clinton mentioned me times in her very long and very boring speech many of her statements were lies and fabrications join at the university of northwestern ohio tonight at pm tickets campaign statement two policemen just shot in san diego one dead it is only getting worse people want law and order crooked hillary clinton made up facts about me and forgot to mention the many problems of our country in her very average scream the media coverage this morning of the very average clinton speech and convention is a joke and the little watched sad no one has worse judgement than hillary clinton corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes hillarys wars in the middle east have unleashed destruction terrorism and isis across the world hillarys vision is a borderless world where working people have no power no jobs no safety hillary will never reform wall street she is owned by wall street our way of life is under threat by radical islam and hillary clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words hillarys refusal to mention radical islam as she pushes a increase in refugees is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country departing

insane with fury he plays t rt obama refers to himself times during hillary nominating speech president obama spoke last night about a world that doesnt exist of the people think our country is going in the wrong direction our country does not feel great already to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty violence and despair shooting deaths of police officers up this year we must

crossing border set to double so far great new poll thank you if russia or any other country or person has hillary clintons illegally deleted emails perhaps they should share them with the fbi join our next vice president in wisconsin tonight and michigan thursday mi wi not one american flag on the massive stage at the democratic national convention until people started complainingthen a small one pathetic our not very bright vice president joe biden just stated that i wanted to carpet bomb the enemy sorry joe that was ted cruz crooked hillary clinton wants to flood our country with syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about the danger is massive no hopefully the violent and vicious killing by isis of a beloved french priest is causing people to start thinking rationally get tough the democratic convention has paid zero respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country no recognition sad funny how the failing is pushing dems narrative that russia is working for me because putin said trump is a genius america st as i have been saying crooked hillary will approve the job killing tpp after the election despite her statements to the contrary top adv just like i have warned from the beginning crooked hillary clinton will betray you on the tpp many of bernies supporters have left the arena did bernie go home and go to sleep i hate to say it but the republican convention was far more interesting with a much more beautiful set than the democratic convention no matter what bill clinton says and no matter how well he says it the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible highly overrated you have no idea what my strategy on isis is and neither does isis a good thing please get your facts straight thanks for the record i have zero investments in russia in order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the wikileakes disaster the dems said maybe it is russia dealing with trump crazy dems dont want to talk isis bc hillarys foreign interventions unleashed isis and her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here bernies exhausted he just wants to shut down and go home to bed the invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for crooked hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar thank you new hampshire join us in toledo ohio tomorrow night at pm tickets join us tomorrow in scranton pennsylvania at pm tickets pocahontas bombed last night sad to watch why arent the democrats speaking about isis bad trade deals broken borders police and law and order the republican convention was great funny if you listen to the democrats did not have a good day if you listen to the other two they are fawning what a difference bernie sanders totally sold out to crooked hillary clinton all of that work energy and money and nothing to show for it waste of time elizabeth warren often referred to as pocahontas just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about crooked hillary who she always hated sad to watch bernie sanders abandon his revolution we welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs if cory booker is the future of the democratic party they have no future i know more about cory than he knows about himself i was at and met juan williams in passing he asked if he could have pictures taken with me i said fine he then trashes on air hard to believe that bernie sanders has done such a complete fold he got nothing for all of the time energy and money the vp a joke while bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers clinton betrayed bernie voters kaine supports tpp is in pocket of wall street and backed iraq war thank you ohio thank you roanoke virginia be back soon make america safe and great again great poll numbers are coming out all over people dont want another four years of obama and crooked hillary would be even worse the state of florida is so embarrassed by the antics of crooked hillary clinton and debbie wasserman schultz that they will vote for change wow the republican convention went so smoothly compared to the dems total mess but fear not the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn here we go again with another clinton scandal and emails yet can you believe crooked hillary knew the fix was in b never had a chance crooked hillary clinton knew everything that her servant was doing at the dnc they just got caught thats all they laughed at bernie if bernie sanders after seeing the just released emails continues to look exhausted and done then his legacy will never be the same thank you hillary was involved in the email scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened how much bad judgement was on display by the people in dnc in writing those really dumb emails using even religion against bernie the new joke in town is that russia leaked the disastrous dnc emails which should never have been written stupid because putin likes me watched crooked hillary clinton and tim kaine on minutes no way they are going to fix americas problems isis and all others laughing the ratings for the republican national convention were very good but for the final night my speech great thank you the highly neurotic debbie wasserman schultz is angry that after stealing and cheating her way to a crooked hillary victory shes out the democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing emails say the rigged system is alive and well even though bernie sanders has lost his energy and his strength i dont believe that his supporters will let crooked hillary off the hook crooked hillary clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top dws too bad bernie flamed out if the republican convention had blown up with emails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player bernie media would go wild the panels are so one sided almost all against trump is so much better and the ratings are much higher dont watch cnn i always said that debbie wasserman schultz was overrated the dems convention is cracking up and bernie is exhausted no energy left today proves what i have always known that priebus is the tough one and the smart one not debbie wasserman shultz sorry folks but bernie sanders is exhausted just cant go on any longer he is trying to dismiss the new emails and dnc disrespect sad there is no longer a bernie sanders political revolution he is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figurewants it all to end an analysis showed that bernie sanders would have won the democratic nomination if it were not for the super delegates looks like the bernie people will fight if not their blood sweat and tears was a total waste of time kaine stands for opposite wow president obamas brother malik just announced that he is voting for me was probably treated badly by presidentlike everybody else bernie sanders started off strong but with the selection of kaine for vp is ending really weak so much for a movement total disrespect the crooked hillary vp choice is very disrespectful to bernie sanders and all of his supporters just another case of bad judgement by h thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on thursday night from the heart the wikileaks email release today was so bad to sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her unless he is a fraud just saw crooked hillary and tim kaine together isis and our other enemies are drooling they dont look presidential to me i will bring jobs back and get wages up people havent had a real wage increase in almost twenty years clinton killed jobs tim kaine has been praising the trans pacific partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved job killer funny that the democrats would have their convention in pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs i will bring jobs back crooked hillary clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in pennsylvania against steelworkers and miners husband signed nafta leaked emails of dnc show plans to destroy bernie sanders mock his heritage and much more online from wikileakes really vicious rigged pocahontas wanted vp slot so badly but wasnt chosen because she has done nothing in the senate also crooked hillary hates her tim kaine is and always has been owned by the banks bernie supporters are outraged was their last choice bernie fought for nothing the bernie sanders supporters are furious with the choice of tim kaine who represents the opposite of what bernie stands for philly fight i highly recommend the just out book the field of fight by general michael flynn how to defeat radical islam is it the same kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while governor of virginia and didnt get indicted while bob m did another attack this time in germany many killed god bless the people of munich one of the best produced including the incredible stage and set in the history of conventions great unity big tv ratings thank you cleveland

by me to be vp just arrived in cleveland will be a great two days statement on melania speech the media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of melanias speech than the fbi spent on hillarys emails good news is melanias speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press in november i think the people of ohio will remember that the republicans picked cleveland instead of going to another state jobs bill hemmer of was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena more than in past years congratulations to my children don and tiffany on having done a fantastic job last night i am very proud of you such a great honor to be the republican nominee for president of the united states i

our police our country is divided and out of control the world is watching we grieve for the officers killed in baton rouge today how many law enforcement and people have to the ratings at blow away the ratings of not even close thats because cnn is the clinton news network and people dont like is much better and far more truthful than which is all negative guests are stacked for crooked hillary i dont watch if goofy elizabeth warren a very weak senator didnt lie about her heritage being native american she would be nothing today pick her h i hope that crooked hillary picks goofy elizabeth warren sometimes referred to as pocahontas as her vp then we can litigate her fraud it doesnt matter that crooked hillary has experience look at all of the bad decisions she has made bernie said she has bad judgement as the days and weeks go by we see what a total mess our country and world is in crooked hillary clinton led obama into bad decisions we are going to have a great time in cleveland

i will solve and fast it is amazing how often i am right only to be criticized by the media illegal immigration take the oil build the wall muslims nato remember when i recently said that brussels is a hell hole and a mess and the failing wrote a critical article i was so right these politicians like cruz and graham who have watched isis and many other problems develop for years do nothing to make things better and lyin ted cruz are two politicians who are very much alike all talk and no action both talk about isis do nothing it is amazing how gets on so many tv shows talking negatively about me when i beat him so badly zero in his pres run we pay a disproportionate share of the cost of nato why it is time to renegotiate and the time is now nato is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on make america great again i want to thank for all of his help in our historic arizona win could not have done it without you joe while i believe i will clinch before cleveland and get more than delegates it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race i think having jebs endorsement hurts lyin ted jeb spent more than and got nothing i spent a fraction of that and am first i will be the best by far in fighting terror im the only one that was right from the beginning and now lyin ted and others are copying me just watched hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror shes been in office fighting terror for years and look where we are low energy jeb bush just endorsed a man he truly hates lyin ted cruz honestly i cant blame jeb in that i drove him into oblivion lyin ted cruz steals foreign policy from me and lines from michael douglas just another dishonest politician thank you arizona lyin ted cruz denied that he had anything to do with the gq model photo post of melania thats why we call him lyin ted hopefully the republican party can come together and have a big win in november paving the way for many great supreme court justices much bigger win than anticipated in arizona thank you i will never forget thank you arizona incompetent hillary despite the horrible attack in brussels today wants borders to be weak and openand let the muslims flow in no way lyin ted cruz just used a picture of melania from a gq shoot in his ad be careful lyin ted or i will spill the beans on your wife pres obama should leave the baseball game in cuba immediately and get home to washington where a under a serious emergency belongs obama and all others have been so weak and so politically correct that terror groups are forming and getting stronger shame message from message from video my heart and prayers go out to all of the victims of the terrible tragedy this madness must be stopped and i will stop it watch this clip from earlier this year time and time again i have been right about terrorism its time to get tough i have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody

out of politics if ted cruz is so opposed to gay marriage why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage ted is the ultimate hypocrite says one thing for money does another for votes great new numbers thank you ted cruz purposely and illegally did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks they own him based on the fact that ted cruz was born in canada and is therefore a natural born canadian did he borrow unreported loans from c banks oh no just reported that ted cruz didnt report another loan this one from citi wow no wonder banks do so well in the us senate the ted cruz wiseguy apology to the people of new york is a disgrace remember his wifes employer and his lender is located there was there another loan that ted cruz forgot to file goldman sachs owns him he will do anything they demand not much of a reformer ted cruz said he didnt know that he was a canadian citizen he also forgot to file his goldman sachs million loan

and pyramids built for grain storage dont people get it such bad reporting a puff piece on ben carson in the states that carson is trying to solidify his lead but i am easily sad florida ethics commission advocate comes down hard on rubio so do two people who worked with him said he used the wrong credit card sure a great honor to easily finish first in the poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner the carson story is either a total fabrication or if true even worsetrying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend rubio lied about my meeting w hispanic activists i didnt change my opinion but treated them w respect shame should have corrected jeb bush when he said that i ran for president twice never ran merely considered running jeb bush just said about marco rubio hes my friend pure political speak why cant he be truthful and say disloyal guy no friend also tune in to the at am i will be on to discuss the campaign my

attacking iraq when there were no weapons of mass destruction bad info this morning chris wallace has the best political show on television but thats only because im on it kidding have fun jeb bush
